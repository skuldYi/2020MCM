## Background
- 网购平台日益崛起，由于订单不受时间、地点的限制和送货上门等优势，许多用户选择在网上购物。但是在网购平台上，用户看不到实物，只能通过商品图片和简介来了解商品，这催生了**评论机制**，即已购买者可以通过星级来表达他们对产品的满意度，还可以通过文本来表达对产品的更多意见和信息。其他客户可以通过阅读这些评论，来协助他们的购买决策。公司也会根据这些评论数据来改进产品设计的优缺点。但我们发现，这些评论中存在用户（可能是竞争对手）恶意的评论和公司通过收买评论者而得到的好评。而这些评价可能对用户的购买决策和接下来的评论内容造成重大影响，我们需要通过分析星级、评论内容和评论时间等数据来得到更为具体的结果。

~~With the rise of the online marketplace, quantities of people are used to shopping online for its convenient and active service.  However, in the online marketplace, customers can only gain product information through the picture and profile for they can't touch, see, and test the product personally. Fortunately, the online marketplace provides customers with an opportunity to rate and review purchases, which gives them a stage to represent their satisfaction with a product. Purchasers can give star ratings and submit messages that express further information and opinions about the product. These reviews help not only browsers make purchasing decisions, but companies improve the pros and cons of product design. However, we found that there are malicious comments from customers(possibly competitors) and groups of positive reviews which may come from a click farm. These comments may have a significant impact on the customers' purchasing decisions and purchasers' future ratings and reviews. We need to analyze the data of star rating, review content and review time to identify key patterns or measures on product desirability or reputation.~~ ~~我自己爬~~
In recent years, quantities of customers prefer to shopping online for its less spacetime limitation and the convenient home delivery service. However, compared to the traditional physical stores, customers can only evaluate products by the provided profile and pictures instead of seeing or testing the real ones. The information gap here is one of the leading causes of dissatisfied purchases. To help customers know the product better, many online marketplace platforms, such as Amazon, launch a "review system". Customers can express their level of satisfaction and further opinions or information about purchases through rating and reviewing. That additional information can help not only other customers make purchasing decisions, but companies improve the pros and cons of product design.
However, we found that not all reviews are equally relevant. Some reviews are too general; some people's ratings do not match their reviews; there are even deliberately misleading reviews, such as malicious defamation from competitors or the raise by the bribed reviewers. Therefore, when using data to assist business decisions, we need to analyze data carefully and comprehensively to obtain more accurate results. More factors should be considered, such as the ratings, review contents and review time, rather than straightly calculate the average rating level.
## Problem analysis
- 通过分析三个产品数据集，描述有助于评估产品的星级、评论和帮助等级的定量和/或定性模式、关系、度量和参数，并用数据证明他们确实有用。
- 通过建模解决以下问题
	- 根据ratings和reviews确定一个最informative的度量，这个度量可以跟踪三种产品上市后的产品评级。
	- 分别在三个数据集里，分析产品评级和时间的关系。
	- 寻找能影响产品评级拐点的关键因素。
	- 分析一段时间内是否会有较为集中的好评或差评，客户star rating是否会被最近评论影响。
	- 评级star rating和评论内容review的关键字是否匹配。
- Analyze the three product data sets to describe quantitative and/or qualitative patterns, relationships that help evaluate a product's star ratings, reviews and helpfulness ratings. Use data to demonstrate that they are valuable.
- Solve the following issues through modelling:
	- Determine the most informative metric based on ratings and reviews. This metric can track the product ratings of three products when they are on the market.
	- Analyze the relationship between product ratings and time in three data sets.
	- Look for critical factors that can affect the inflexion point of product ratings through time.
	- Analyze whether there will be more a series of positive or negative reviews over a while and whether customer star ratings will be affected by recent reviews.
	- Whether star rating and the keyword of review content match.
## Data
### DataSource
> 已翻译
- Our model is informed by the customer-supplied ratings and reviews for microwave ovens, baby pacifiers, and hair dryers sold in the Amazon marketplace over more than 10 years.
### Pre-processing
- 删除冗余
	- 地区marketplace
	- 商品种类product_category;
	- 没有使用：评论标识review_id; 产品标识product_id
- 删除错误数据
	- `verify_purchase == N`的评论全部删除

# Assumption
- 商家的目的：通过优质评论和近期评论引导用户购买产品
	- 根据题目要求理解得到
- 评论内容和星级评定应保持基本一致，不一致时人们更相信评论
	- 基于大众心理，真实的语言更令人信服
- 特邀测评员的评论更可信 `vine == Y`，不包含因免费获得产品而打高分的主观性因素
	- 由网购平台选出的特邀测评员是有大数据支持的，他们的评价更为客观、有效。
- 实际购买人的评论更可信 `verify_purchase == Y`
	- 已经体验过产品的人更了解产品的真实性能
- 实际未购买人的评论完全不可信 `verify_purchase == N`
	- 列出未购买人与购买人与全体之间1-5星的分布，可以看出未购买人中1星较其他两项多很多，考虑是竞争对手恶意评论或已购买人不满意产品或服务从而邀请亲友（未购买）为其打低分来报复商家。
- Merchant's purpose: Guide users to buy products with quality reviews and recent reviews
	- According to the requirements
- The content of the review and the star rating should be the same. People believe in reviews when review content is inconsistent with star ratings.
	- Based on popular psychology, real language is convincing 
- Amazon Vine members' reviews are credible `vine == Y`, excluding subjective factors that give high ratings for free products
	- Big data select Amazon Vine members. Their evaluations are more objective and practical.
- Actual purchasers' reviews are credible. `verify_purchase == Y`
	- People who have already experienced the product know more about the actual performance of the product.
- Comments from actual non-purchasers are untrustworthy.`verify_purchase == N`
	- We listed the distribution of 1-5 stars between the non-purchasers and the purchasers. It shows that the non-purchasers give more 1 star than purchasers, which may mislead the reviews.
