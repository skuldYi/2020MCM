I found everything goes well except the plug. Why the left and right is opposite and I have to put the plug upside down for charging!!! Another flaw is the big noise.
The styling tip does not stay on, keeps falling off in the middle of blow drying and then it's too hot to put back
Great blowdryer. it gets the job done. the only thing i dislike is how it is not compatible with universal comb attachments. also as i blowdry my hair the attachment keeps falling off
Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.
So far, so good ...
The ends are pink. Not what I expected
Not as hot and powerful as I expected and somehow it does not deliver any kind of expected shining usually produced by professional ceramic dryers...
Never had a blow dryer tangle my hair and make it limp. It does get your hair dry slowly.
I was hoping for a quieter blow dryer. This is definitely quieter than my other dryer, but still not quiet. I also read all kinds of reviews that said this dries your hair so it's smooth and silky. The only thing that makes my hair smooth and silky is product!
needs an expensive transformer
I enjoyed using this at the beginning.  After few months of use, it gets over hot easily and I have to stop and wait until it cools down.
This hair dryer is one of the fastest drying hair dryers I've ever used. It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.<br /><br />I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.<br /><br />It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance. I hope it lasts me a few more years.<br /><br />Overall, this hair dryer is usable but might cause some frustration.
Great blow dryer, just a little more heavy than I expected
buttons interfere with handle.  always turning off
It stays true to it's name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn't buy this if I have thicker hair.
Gets the job done. Downfall is the bonnet connection keeps popping off so you must keep reattaching it.
Dryer works great but be careful with cord. Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.
I have had alot of hair dryers over the years, i liked this one because it was pink and I could order it on Amazon Prime. However...the highest setting blows more like a medium/low setting which just erks me. If you have thin hair you probably won't mind but if you have thicker hair like myself this is just pain annoying!`
Bought as a replacement for the previous version of this dryer because it finally stopped working after more than 5 years, but I was disappointed when I received it because the power cord is way too short and the power itself is not nearly as strong as the previous model. It'll work for now but I would definitely not buy it again.
I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!<br /><br />Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!
The hair dryer itself is great; but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible.  The fingers on the attachment are made of rubber and break off.
Not as strong as the older built unit with same stock #, name, and specs.
It's ok for the price.<br /><br />The plastic feels cheap, the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser, i feel as i may break it. The plug isn't the most secure either, seeming to fit loosely in the socket. Despite this, it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn't failed me yet after about 6 months of use. If you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick.
I like the dryer - I know this will sound silly but the color in the picture is the reason I chose this one but it is not HOT pink as it looks in the picture it is more like a Peto Bismol color. Other than that it is fine.
Nothing to complaint about its functions.  However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter's long hair.
For the price (and based on other reviewers), I was expecting a lot more.  I have very long, thick hair and the Sedu Revolution does dry my hair faster (cut about 10 minutes off drying time); however, it actually makes my hair more frizzy!  Not good!!  The hair dryer is also heavy and loud!!!  Based on the packaging, it looks like I received a previously used blow dryer that someone else returned.  I would never recommend this blow dryer to anyone!
Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  Definitely made my hair softer.  Still would recommend.
I like the looks of these and have purchased a number of them for the rentals I manage as they mount on the wall. Out of about six I've bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it's had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type.
The hairdryer blows air very softly if that's such a thing.  Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.
Does the job,but not what I expected.
Good functionality but Too heavy!
The string is too tight around the head. I wish they would bring back the gold bonnet one back. I had to settle for this one because I couldn't find that other one. But I'm not a real fan of this BUT it still gets the job done.
The hose and bonnet  does not  stay connected  . It needs to have  way to lock it in place.
The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn't seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past
I bought this keeping in mind that the cool shot button may not work after reading a review. I blow dry my hair at most 3 times for the year so for me it does the job. I use the cool setting which still feels a little warm to me but it helps to stretch my hair very well but without the heat damage (I still use heat protectant though). But.. the cool shot button DEFINITELY DOESN'T WORK
Too bulky.
Low setting is to strong and to fast also the dryer is too heavy
Not as powerful as some.this size.  Easy to mount to wall.  It does have a bright night light.
Ended up being a little TOO powerful.
It's ok.
The dryer itself works great , but the attachments don't stay on. I was spending more time picking the attachments up off the floor than drying my hair, really a piss poor design very frustrating
I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.
It does the job but fan makes a funny noise when powering down.
My old blow dryer was this exact model and I absolutely loved it. However, the one that came in from Amazon for this purchase disappointed me as the retractable cord doesn't work.
Not very strong. Does the job. Doesn't have a lot of heft so it makes me think it won't last long, which is fine since we don't really love it.
**UPDATE 07/09/17**  This dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece. It makes a click noise and then gets hot. I recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it. My husband and I looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on. I hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others.<br />Original review: his almost perfect. I love the finish. Very hot with several great settings. Its a bit heavy. The cord is a bit short. My hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times, knotting it and burning it. I have longer hair and this happens when I flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots. I have had to learn to keep space. I would buy it again though.
It's nice and dries quickly, just it's super noisy, can wake the neighbors up!
It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor. It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!
Lasted about a year.  I'm back to Remington, I used Remington hair dryers for years and they last the longest.  Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.
I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again
This hair dryer is not adjustable and does not have enough heating power
Dryer itself works ok. Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a tangled unraveled cord. Not suitable for a gift. Ok if it's for your own personal use.
üëçüèΩ
I expected it to be smaller.
Just got this blow dryer.  It doesn't blow as hot as I expected it to heat up.  Just used it to style my hair.  But is definitely better than the ones you'd find a Walmart, etc...My hair is relaxed and tends to absorb a lot of water.  I Will post an update later with additional feedback...
Nothing too special here.  Okay hair dryer.
Good  but loud
Love it but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time!!!
Not thrilled about this one. It's cheap and it shows. Heavy to hold and dries the hair on the slower side. It doesn't have that hurricane effect as some other cheaper model. I wouldn't recommend it.
Bit on the noisy side. Has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying. Otherwise, nice and light weight.
The unit was cracked in serveral places when I received it, but all-in-all it worked fairly well.
Cord no longer retracts.
Works as a blow drier but not as well as the RV544 for just a little bit more money.
There are not 3 levels of heat. There ARE 3 levels of blowing air, but I wish the heat was different. Not what I expected. I do like the retractable cord for the convenience of storage. I've used the dryer for about 3 weeks.
The only con is that it doesn't reach the back of my head. I'd have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while, and that cramps up my neck a lot :(
It was OK - liked the heaviness of it but was nothing more than just a drugstore blow dryer. Was hoping for  more of a difference due to the &#34;Tourmaline Ceramic&#34; name but nothing special or different than my last Conair blow dryer.
Its ok... light weight but noisey.
The dryer has several good features, and I especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all.  Other dryers I've had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.  Luckily I was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently (prompting this purchase).  Otherwise I would have had to return this dryer, even as much as I'm loving the cool air feature.  Hence only a three star rating.
Didn't work with an inverter or converter started smoking while abroad. But has a lot of power for a small dryer
Good when working.  Cord broke at handle in a few months
I had high hopes for this dryer based on the reviews, but it's marginal at best.  The heat setting is pretty weak, and if you have a ton of hair, forget about it.  For me, I'll keep using it, but my wife said she'd never be able to use this on a daily basis.
Pros:  Saves room on the counter, compact size, HI setting is strong.<br /><br />Cons:  It only lasted two years and one month.  Had to re-order one again today because we had already installed the metal panel on the wall and didn't want to have to take it off and repaint and redo it all.<br /><br />Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer. We shall see...
good product
I thought I was buying the same dryer as my old one.  This one takes much longer to dry my hair and the cord is not as long.
Good dryer but the buttons aren't easy to move.
Longer than I thought it was from the picture.  Actual dimensions are needed.
Just okay....doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it. The filter door keeps popping open too....I kept it, but not all that thrilled with it.
Not very powerful and took me longer than usual to dry my hair.
Awkward grip on handle, it kinda bugs my finger holding it. Doesn't dry my hair as fast as other blow dryers I've had.
Still works great but all the graphics came off within a week. If you have any product on your hands, expect the same results.
Not really a travel dryer unless you travel &#34;big&#34;.
Tended to make my hair frizz instead of curl
Worked well in Israel with adapter but only on low power despite changing the voltage. I thought I blew it out after only a few seconds on high power. Thankfully it worked on low a few minutes later when it cooled down. OverAll it did the job but def doesn't replace a real blow dryer.
Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &#34;loving&#34; this.  It's heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  The attachments work well.  It's mid-sized, so if you're wanting something light and small, this isn't it.  Mid-sized and heavy......I would not buy again.
I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It's does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking. I like it but can't wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer.
Not a lot of power. It takes a lot longer to dry long hair than with other dryers. The brush attachment is also a little too soft for hair straightening.
To much noise but does the work.
When it works right it is my dream blowdryer.  Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.<br />  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air<br />pik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushes<br />and vary the heat along each section of hair.  No matter how<br />I style it, I come out with much shinier less frizzy hair.<br />Rewind about 2003-2004: Bought this model in a store,<br />loved it, and used it til it died in about 2007. Bought<br />another from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.<br />Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At first<br />it only happened once or twice, which is just one of those<br />things that can happen for no good reason.  I bought another<br />after the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just a<br />bad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.<br />Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.<br />After a burned hand I decided I should try and find another<br />dryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works in<br />the salon industry and she told me the company that made<br />my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.<br />That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have moved<br />from where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries went<br />great.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCI<br />outlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated and<br />turned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, or<br />at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn't<br />need.  I'm heartbroken over that.  If the manufacturer could<br />address that problem, I would be SO happy.<br />The seller on Amazon was reasonably priced and got my<br />item to me quickly and ingood condition.
night light too bright
Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16. Blows hot and cold.
Used this hair dryer in England last month. It worked fine with the adapter. My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot. I dry my hair in sections and I could hardly get a section dry before my scalp would start to burn.
This blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the Revlon one I am replacing this with.  It dries my hair in a fair amount of time but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  The curved handle on this does not allow you to do this.  Other than that I like it and I like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer.
Bought the leopard version of this blow dryer because of the cheaper price and I LOVE it. It is a great blowdryer and I would recommend it to every hair stylist. UPDATE: now 7-8 months later my blowdryer is broken. I really loved this blowdryer but mine just stopped work and only blows cold air now. Very disappointing.
It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry Salon hair. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.
This sounds weird, but the &#34;night light&#34; is MUCH TOO BRIGHT.  I had to tape something over it to mute the light.  The mounting bracket is tricky to install and kind of flimsy too
A little heavy on the hand but works well.
Not as good as the one I had 10 years ago. The old one was a better quality and this make hair a little frizzy
Does not blow hard enough for me. Bought a different brand and it works great!
This dryer does the job, but it's a little loud, and it doesn't seem to get as hot as my last dryer.  It takes a little longer to dry my hair, but at the price I paid, it was still a good value.  I've had it for many months and it still works fine.
Really good dryer but now its seriously overpriced. Bought ours on Amazon in March for only $32. Totally worth every penny, however totally NOT worth $200. Not sure where the price increase came from.....
The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  I'm still looking for the old-fashioned hat box dryers that I had in the 60's.
The mounting screws that screw the base to the mounting plate are really tiny and flimsy. One of the two screws stripped its thread right away when it was being slightly tighten. It's a shame that a good product fails for something so simple.
I read the reviews and decided to try this.  Maybe BaByliss spoiled me I dunno. My hair is way too dry and doesnt hold its shape. Returning and sticking with BaByliss.
The on/off and heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and feel it might not last as long as others.  I do not use often but others in family will.  Will have to see how it wears.
Nice product, but never got the diffuser it was supposed to come with.
Wife didn't really like it. Wasn't impressed. Works fine though.
Bought dryer for my daughter it isn't hot enough for me but awesome for my 10yr old to dry her thin/fine hair with
Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced. The base is all molded plastic and is not really integrated with the hair dryer. What I mean is that there are two notches cut in to the plastic base and the hair dryer cord is run through the notches with some rubber grommets used to hold the cord in place.<br /><br />There are not a lot of alternative products to choose from and on the plus side it was relatively cheap and easy to install.
Would have preferred a stronger airflow
Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions. It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.
Underpowered.
Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn't last long before it started giving problems. For the money paid, expected the product to hold up longer.
Doesn't seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!
This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that's what your looking for. But it's heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!! Holy crap I'm going def
This is an okay product. If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one. But for the occasional use it's okay
I'm not completely impressed with the cheap plastic although, Ive used it about 6 times and it's still in good condition ( also keep in mind that I am hispanic and have very long, thick and curly hair ). I purchased this because my daughter has one and after using it, I fell in love. But, hers is definitely made with better quality materials, you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality.  I thought I was getting a super steal based on the price I paid for it ($25) opposed to what my daughter paid ( she purchased hers directly from Andis for $52) As I previously mentioned, mines is still in good condition after using it several times, I'm just waiting to see how many more uses I get out of it. This is a case of you get what you pay for.
The lower setting does not work
Not as heavy as I expected.  Works well and the power is good.
It works ok but it's not the easiest drier to use. It has an odor to it and I wish it was just a little smaller in size
The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter.  I like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that I can't style the back of my hair easily.  I have shorter arms but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  Do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer?  I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.
I tend to have frizzy hair.  I honestly haven't noticed a difference between this hair dryer or any old regular hair dryer making my hair less frizzy.  I ordered this one because my old one broke.  I'm not noticing any difference.
I purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago after my old Conair died.  I like to use my dryers on low speed, but high heat.  Although the two settings should be independent, this dryer is just lukewarm on low speed.  It also made my hair fuzzy, and while it was lightweight - it felt cheap.<br /><br />I quit using it two months after I started using it and invested in a better dryer.  I purchased the Elchim 2001 through Amazon, and while it's a bit more expensive ($80), it's worth every penny.  I would not recommend the Conair 1875, unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess.
The dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up catching fire while I was using it. I think for the price it should last longer than 10  months.
OK hair dryer.  I like the non-skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn't slip off bathroom shelf.  The overall drying could be improved.  My Vidal Sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster.  I'm going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath.
A little heavy for a travel dryer
Noisy. I don't see anything professional about this dryer.
I like everything about it except for the night light.  It is too bright for me.
I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot. But the front part of my hair never dries but the back and sides dries in no time at all.
It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had. I like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow.  Wish it wasa little lighter weight.
I don't believe the hair dryer is worth the price. All I can say is that it did not out perform my 5-year old, $30 CONAIR that I purchased from Target.
Good!
A couple of things to think about before buying this dryer. First, the cord is pretty short. It's about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there's no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it. For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer. This dryer is now in the guess bathroom.
Hi, would have given it a 5-star, as it worked really well and was powerful yet quiet.  Unfortunately, not even a year old and with no warning, one day the on/off switch no longer flicked on and off (like a spring had broken inside or something) and I had to throw it away.  Also, the filter is not easily accessible, like with some hair dryers that have a trap door that opens so you can reach them.  The only way to clean the filter is trying to shove a paper clip or pipe cleaner in between the vent slots and see if you can somehow pick the hair/dust out of the filter.
This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a &#34;cool shot&#34; button.
Works fine, I just wish there was a cool setting for those hot days you have to blow dry your hair. It also seems like it doesn't get as hot as my other hair dryer this size.
Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But it didn't do anything extra special to my hair. It's a hair dryer...and it dried my hair. It gets the job done n fits in my luggage. So it does what it's supposed to do.
This hair dryer has a a short cord and you have to have it close too a plug. The other other issue is the on and off switch and the temperature level are too close to where you hold the dryer and the buttons switch on and off all the time.  It's hard to hold the dryer.
little bit heavier than expected.
The hair dryer is quiet and powerful enough to dry my hair, however, the on/off switch stopped working the first day. I did not want to go through taking it off the wall and send it back so I am using this item by plugging and unplugging the hair dryer as needed for use. The switch should last years, but didn't even work for one day.
Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn't leave my hair smooth without frizz . It was also awkward to handle , the nozzle is long . I will go back to my old hair dryer !
It's a really good value for the money.  It is a bit heavier than I am used to and if just got s bit hotter it would be perfect
Nice hair dryer but very heavy.
Ok.... It really dosent get that hot.
Can a blow dryer be too powerful?.. the answer is yes.. it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron.. this was on low setting.. the high setting might as well be a jet engine. . I'm keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly.. one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.
Decent hairdryer, but doesn't really help my hair's tendency to frizz. Also don't like the placement of the &#34;cool&#34; button, I'm always pressing it accidentally. Overall, fine but wouldn't buy again.
Cord doesn't retract all the way
I bought this to replace my &#34;Conair Infinity Pro&#34; hairdryer. What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.
Very short cord, was expecting much longer.
I have very fine hair and it is not &#34;thick&#34;, so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house. Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations. So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.
Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan. But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting. I'd never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it's so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.
This dryer is just cheap.  Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  Granted, it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn't feel like it is just going to snap in two...unfortunately my other one doesn't have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  But hey, it's only for travel...
Cheap blower dryer. It doesn't blow dry very hot air but I did buy it for a good price and it works. This is why I gave it 3 stars.
VERY HEAVY - seems to work well but wouldn't recommend for travel.
The weight is inordinately heavy! Why? My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.<br />It does the job, but I'd recommend a lighter model to a friend.
it didn't fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  TO FIT UNDER IT SO I HAD TO SIT ON A BIG CHAIR COUTON  TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  I HAD ONE BEFOR THAT THE NECK PART WENT UP OR DOWN AND I though this one did it too .
gave 3 stars because it is advertised as having 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds. You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc. Wanted to control heat and speed separately. Nothing wrong with unit otherwise but lowered rating due to not being able to change heat and speed settings independently. Returned for refund.
It is adequate. I do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer. It kind of hurts our heads.
The brush attachment doesn't work well through the hair
Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute! But leaves it so hard frizzy :( it is also very, very loud!!! My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain. I did mot return it, my daughter uses it.
Operates like a very cheap hairdryer. We bought for our 10yr old daughter and it's fine for her. Takes longer to dry hair than most. We may just have a fluke...
Works well but extremely loud.
I hope it last long than the one I got last year
Size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord.
This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  It's a little heavy and somewhat bulky but I like the fact that the cord recoils inside.  It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  I have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does. I had no need for the attachements so I tossed them in the trash.  It works OK, nothing to write home about.
it doesn't work when I plugged it in it didn't work how do I return it
It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor. The airflow is weak even on the highest setting. It says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one. Also it is quite bulky. It does reduce frizz and improve the shine.<br /><br />I recommend it to a person with short and fine hair. If you have coarse or curly hair, I wouldn't pick this one.
Just with the bonnet was easier to fit over rollers. but otherwise a good machine.
I like the temperature settings of cool, warm and hot but would like this dryer more if the flow of air were stronger when set on high.  It seems to take longer for my hair to dry with this dryer.
Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz
Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...and it had been 90 days, so no refund or exchange.
I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I was a little disappointed. It takes a little longer to dry instead of the faster way the review mentioned. It is also not as hot as my regular cheaper blower.
It works well. Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly. It makes me a little nervous bc I have long hair and I am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer.
mine was green
This is the second one we have mine is still going strong after two and a half years...and my daughters bombed out after 2 months and we have to get it replaced
It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.
I have had better, Not very hot.
Worked well and as described.  Motor started to sound like a lawn mower, one week after it's one year warranty.<br />Not happy.
Works well, I wish this could be much smaller
it's not very powerfull but it woks properly
It's good, just what I wanted.
Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.
The disk somehow smells like plastic
This dryer is &#34;ok&#34; I was hoping for something a little more powerful than what I already had. It gets the job done but no quicker than my other blow dryer...in fact I feel like it takes my hair a bit longer to try.  And it is HEAVY. After reading the great reviews, I guess I was hoping for something more than it actually was--which is a regular &#34;ok&#34; hair dryer.
how did this product get so many 5 star reviews?<br />The product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent. The product fails in my view because the three tiny 'Mollies' supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered. The dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times.<br />A better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.<br />Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!
Love it but it's so small. Can't wear rollers with it unless your willing to put in the time to stretch out the cap and pull your hair.
I absolutely loved this dryer! It dried my thick, heavy hair so fast! Also, the cord was fantastically long! Would be 5 stars, but I bought it last April, and sadly it has already died on me. There seems to be a short in the cord. If I wiggle the cord around at the base of the dryer, I can still get it to work a little. Tempted to buy another, since the price is so reasonable.
Kind of weak, not quite powerful or hot enough for my liking.
SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel
best blowdryer I've owned, I've had it for 3 years and still works as good as new.
The powers is not as great as previous dryers I have owned. I bought it because it was pink & pretty. Wish I hadn't now.
Normally I would have rated this item as very high. However of the 3 Hair Dryers purchased, one was defective. While the hair dyer aspect worked, the green light (bottom left side) did not. This defect was not apparent until the Hair Dryer was installed. I understood this to be a good hair dryer, but a defection like this does not look good. I will be thinking twice about any future purchases of this Hair Dryer (regarding product quality) as I can't afford to have a defective unit installed. I had to give my customer a 40% discount because of this. NOT GOOD. Thank you, David
I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle. After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product
It works, but the switch is really cheesy.
Only last for one year.
The dryer looks good and works. I ordered this because a friend's recommendation. Honestly, I feel it is a bit overly expensive. I was hoping my hair would be smooth and shiny after use but the outcome was not that great. Plus, there is no English manual, only Japanese one. A bit frustrated.
I purchased this unit when the more expensive hair dryer I had purchased from Staples online had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!<br />  this dryer is very lightweight and doesn't put out very hot air but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.
It came without instructions.  Works okay.  Nothing above average about it.
Miss the Cool Shot feature of my cheaper dryer, don't feel like it gets as hot either.
Yea
does the job
Do not get hot enough and a little smaller than what I thought.
not as strong as i would like it to be
Not as strong as i expected
I like this dryer but it is a little bit larger than I wanted.  Work really well and is not too loud.
Didn't like the buttons. I've returned it. I'm giving 3 stars not 1 because I used to have Conair Hair Dryer and it was quite good.
A far cry from the Remington hairdryer I have had for 10 years but an acceptable backup.  The diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way too slow/low to dry as quickly as my previous dryer.  Another hairdryer to add to the collection bin.
This hairdryer worked OK for me but did not last too long.  It runs very hot on the high setting; I sometimes worried it might explode because it was soooooo hot.  Therefore, I mostly used the 2 lower settings.  One day, it quit altogether.  The one good thing about it: it was quieter than any other hairdryer I've ever owned.
Nice hair dryer for everyday & travel.<br />Has on-going problems with the retractable cord.
I had same product before they changed the switches.  New switches are hard to adjust.  Other than that, it dries well.
This is really heavy, pretty quiet for the size
This a good hairdryer. I use it as my everyday dryer. It is a bit heavy for packing if weight is an issue.
Excelente.!
It shoots sparks fairly often. Kind of scary.
Updated Review: 4 months after installing this blowdryer, it died. I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.
It works as expected.
My girlfriend loved this dryer...except for the fact that the motor died after a year...super annoyed
Not as powerful as I would have hoped but it's not bad for a cheap guy.
Take's forever to dry my hair. Which is median length. But I like, that it has a cold setting. And you don't have to hold a button, down. Which I really like. All, and all, for what I paid for it, it's okay.
Quite noisy compared to others we have had. Retraction cord has to be jiggled in order to retract.
Need to be very specific on hanging cord or inside wiring.
I'm surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It's fine, it works (so far, we'll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I've used, my hair isn't softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it.
Decent product, although, the air volume doesn't seem to be as good as other similar products like this that I have bought.  I do like that there is a place to hang the cord to get it off the counter.  It does do the job, so I am fairly pleased with it.
The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  I bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter's favorite color, but when it arrived, it was very pink, which was disappointing.  It should have had a better description in the specs.
Connectors always comes off. Overheats. Put on medium setting and it gets the job done. Not 100% what I wanted but it works.
Nice dryer, although heavy. Cord was no longer retractable after only 2 mos. of use. Disappointing to say the least as that was one of the reasons I chose this dryer in particular. Drat!
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter. Works okay but doesn't put out a lot of heat. Works great for her, she has short hair. However I have shoulder length hair and it would take to long for me to try and use. Great value, for younger girls it's sufficient. I would recommend a better blow dryer if you have a lot of hair or don't have a lot of time to spend blowing drying your hair.
The low speed doesn't dry very well.  The high speed is very loud.  It does the job but I wouldn't buy again.
Works as expected, but the Scotch sticky mounts don't hold up against steam...
I like this hair dryer, but it's just not well suited for a man's use - especially in the gym.  I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  It's also much heavier than I expected it to be.  I decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment.<br /><br />A word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit.  The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me.  I still have a sore spot on my finger a week later.  Be careful when opening.
I know some other reviewers have raved about this hair dryer. For me, it's just okay. It gets the job done. I've got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They're sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn't do much for me. It works, and I'm keeping it. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again.
Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.
I'm a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process.<br /><br />My last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic. Worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat.<br /><br />This one had good reviews and was cheap. So I bought it.<br /><br />Although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job, exactly what I wanted, it smelt like burning plastic. Maybe it's jsut a new hair dryer? Regardless, I am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product. Wish a company could make a small, powerful hair dryer for $20 that just worked and was durable.
Great when it works but tends to overheat and shuts down.
Wife likes it but it looks a bit cheap
You get what you pay for with this item.  It works with no issue,  but has very minimal power.  My hair is average thickness and shoulder length and it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to dry.  It's also not particularly hot.  It does get the job done though which is why I'm giving it three stars.  Spend a few extra bucks and get a better one.
After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle blew...I'll continue to use until the other blows but I won't buy another.
The diffuser works well...when it isn't falling off my dryer. I just bought a Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up. I wouldn't recommend it for this hair dryer, but it might work well for others.
works well the only problem is the tip wont stay on
Product came quickly but not sure I'd buy it again. The attachment falls off very easily.
This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses. I feel like I'm not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don't use it at all. It's well made and clearly does what it says, but since it's effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.
Except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory
the bonnet is not big enought for big roller
Cord doesn't retract very well
Kind of weak
I love it! Heats up nice it isn't to heavy the only down side is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together. Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag. So far so good but I really hope it holds up
Does what it says on the tin! A simple, inexpensive hairdryer. I do wish the &#34;High/Off/Low&#34; switch were more like a &#34;High/Low/Off&#34; switch since I accidentally push it too far every time I use it. But it was a minor concern and it's not as if I'll accidentally leave it on. Just a minor inconvenience.
My hair still stays frizzy but it does dry a bit faster.
Really hard to turn on the switches. Otherwise it would be a great hair dryer.
I have had this blow dryer for 6 months. The first five months it worked great then all of a sudden it fell apart. The blow dryer started over heating and then it would shut off then the attachment wouldnt stay on anymore and the comb broke into pieces. I have bought new comb attachment pieces because I dont feel like buying an entire new blow dryer.
Nothing to get excited about. It works well and I like the cool temperature setting.  The cord is much shorter than the hair dryer I had to replace.
I have this for awhile now and it get s the job done after a long while of blow drying. It doesn't get as hot as it supposed to and blows cool air when on hot. The colors are great and it is light weight but if you have thick hair i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better hair dryer.
Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds. Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn't surprised, but I did expect the &#34;Hot&#34; setting to be warmer. The &#34;Warm&#34; is barely above cool.
This was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out.
Not big on heat styling my hair anyway but I expected more. It's a subpar blow dryer at best. It'll dry your hair eventually but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair. Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me. I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.
It does not get hot, but that's better of hair anyway.
The switch is placed in the wrong place, because I accidentally shut it off all the time.  On the plus side, it is quieter than the last few dryers I have used.
I bought this dryer based on other reviews that I read.  It's not heavy and it does a great job.  However, I should have read the product description in more detail--I did not notice it did not have a retractable power cord and it does not have a folding handle for easy storage.  I feel the design of the controls to be a bit flimsy--haven't had this style in the past.  Overall,  it does the job and it wasn't expensive.
This compact hair dryer is very powerful but too loud.
(FYI) only produces an adequate heat on the high setting, medium and low settings only achieve a warm temp. Low price, sturdy, long thick cord, very light, strong fan.
I got this to replace my gold 'n hot one that I'd had for years. The brush attachment is very thin and pretty much useless in my thick hair. The gold n hot brush had way more bristles that were sturdier. Other than that, it hets hot and dries my hair, but not as straight as the gold n hot.
I liked it but ended up returning b/c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands.
The needles were not log enough.  I RETURNED IT
I would not buy this again.  It works well and does its purpose.  My complaints are it is heavy and loud!
The only problem I have with this product is that the comb are not durable
Diffuser could be bigger. But it is ok.
Works well
3 stars - it's ok. I feel like this hair dryer is a little lacking in both heat and strength, but for the price I can't complain too much. I generally let me hair air dry or only use it for my bangs, so it does the job. If you're a serious blow dryer, go for something else, Personally, I'll go for a different model next time, but in the meantime, I'm fine with it.
Heavy, my expectation was much too high. The $ cost was high too.
This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use - it's larger than I thought it would be. Like really large. I recently purchased hot-boxed hair extensions, and bought this to make my life a bit easier (as I can't blow-dry upside-down), after a recommendation by my hair stylist. It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it's very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush. Make sure you give yourself enough time to dry your hair, as it will take a while trying to use this.
Heavier and Bulkier than my previous blow dryer. Not impressed.
It's very hard to use the diffuser because the dryer itself is so heavy.
It's a really good product to the price so cheap!
It's a fine, but loud hairdryer. You can find a ceramic one in Kmart for a lower price.
I returned mine. I got it to take with me to the gym to dry my hair after a sweaty workout and it was not powerful enough for my thick hair. I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one but still, it was useless for me.
Cord is TOO stiff.  I would have expected the cord to be supple.  Alas, the cord behaves as if it's frozen even at a temperature of 84 degrees F.
My mother uses ever day
I really wanted more speeds as it turns out. Not very powerful. I gave it to my husband who doesn't have much hair.
I was really excited about this hairdryer and it's retractable cord, but it really hasn't lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it's just okay. It's no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn't retract all the way. Overall, it's not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.
its good
Cap is too small to put over my rollers.
a little big for me. Hard to carry with travel
Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed. Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high but it probably should be a single speed. The night light is nice to have in the bathroom. Overall I'm happy with it but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you.
Worked great while it lasted - which was less than a year.
Space saver for sure. A bit loud and dryer opening is small.
Thanks to all
Not the best dryer I've ever used but, for the price, I can't complain.
The attachments don't stay on too well and the cord is really short.
This was a an ok product. Stopped working after about 5 months of use
It's what I would expect from a 25 dollar hair dryer.  Not many extra, but does the job.
Good value but crummy dryer. Doesn't get very hot but it isn't too noisy...it was cheap so didn't have super high expectations.
This hair dryer is okay. Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short so you almost need to hold it on your lap when using it. Also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear. A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.
My other Conair 1875 was starting to turn itself off (shorting out?) during use so I hunted Amazon reviews for a good one with Prime shipping. This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).
This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it.
An excellent dryer, but heavier than most. The retractable cord is a great feature, but adds to the weight.
Works well but you need a lot of space to store it.  It's like a giant robotic arm.
bulky and too noisy..
Switch is hard to turn on/off.
Fine product
Too loud !! Not enough heat!!
this is a nice dryer but I saw NO change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use.<br />Bottom line... Not worth the $$$
Cute but cheaply made.
its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good
I liked this dryer a lot, and it was a great dryer for the price.  However, a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat.  Probably won't bother with this brand again, as I see the same thing has happended to other users.
This hair dryer functions properly and is light enough to maneuver, but the buttons are a challenge (and I'm a middle-aged person). You need to slide them up to manipulate the heat level and another parallel set of sliding buttons to turn it on. It's a struggle every day.
dood
Light weight, not too noisy and plenty of airflow. Not sure it will last a long time, but well worth the cost. Bought two of them.<br /><br />Update since reviewing this, both units have failed in the same way, power switch stops working. Too bad, these are cheap, light weight, not too noisy and good airflow.
Good hair dryer but kinda heavy
It is a good product if you're using small or medium rollers.  The bonnet is too small for Large or Jumbo rollers so I only used once and packed it in my closet for whenever I decide to cut my hair shorter and can use smaller rollers.  It only came with one attachment, not two like the picture shows.  I like how you can store the hose, bonnet, and power cord inside the case.
I found the Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer very hard to turn on, choose my heat selection and choose the intensity of the blower.  I think Conair should have made the ridges on the two selectors more pronounced.  I also found the low setting far too powerful to comfortably style my bangs.  What I do like, compared to other hair dryer makes is that the cold air button was extremely user friendly.  The dryer itself works just fine and is comfortable to hold.
I can't say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black<br /><br />I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.<br /><br />The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!
The cord does not retract very well.
just ok
for the price and  size of item works ok.
Works well but both of us frequently turn of the hair dryer by accident because of knob placement..
The hair dryer I purchased in June has burned up and has to be replaced. It was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.
Air flow was not as strong as I'd hoped it would be.
Bought this for my wife before leaving on vacation. It works great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-light weight<br />-dries hair quickly<br />-folds up for easy packing in the luggage<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cord not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)
Not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers.<br />Small and lightweight.
Good but could have one option faster, but the rest work great for person how doesn't has a lot of hair.
This little dryer works well as a travel dryer, especially since it folds. However, as with most small dryers, the noise it makes is pretty horrifying - loud loud loud.
Broke right away.  Plastic end over filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.
clumsy apparatis - I wanted more mobility - like multitacking and this is not set up to run with the flow - hose waned to stay on box and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable
Nice one.....
Doesn't get very hot, take longer to dry hair
I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn't have very much power.
with one arm cut off due to and accident it does the job
A decent dryer for the price. However, I was expecting more air flow and quicker drying for 1875 watts. My previous Conair dryer, which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts, put out more air. Still, for the price, this one gets the job done.
Ok
The buttons are touched to easily when holding it. Also there should be 3 speeds on the air blowing.
Dryers looks good its ok  but you need to spend some more time to get your hair dried.
Awkward
Very powerful and very warm air.  I use it to dry my dog after a bath and the cord is just way t0o short compared to my last dryer.
The hose from the base to the bonnet is rather short.  Overall good quality for the price.
I am a professional and have tried many dryers. My personal one blew up so I got this one. It's not that great. Be prepared to dry your hair for 30 minutes.
Happy female family with this.
I have thick Polynesian hair so in my case, it doesn't give off enough blow power to get through my large mane. Looks like a good idea though.
Heat stops working sometimes. Still blows air.
I liked that it has a 3 heat (low, mid, high) settings, and great price.
Disappointed that 2 years have gone by and it died.  Seems to be the life of these hair dryers as this one was my 2nd.  Not sure that I am buying a 3rd as I don't feel like buying a new hair dryer every 2 years.
I have always used Conair hair dryers but I am not fond of this one at all. Sub-par for their usual quality.
The dryer arrived as pictured......however, the cord is REALLY long and hard to manage.  It would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom.......Conair needs to shorten this cord by a good 12 inches.
The turn on/off switch is really hard to move.
I was looking for something to travel with, that is why I was attracted to the fold down and retractable cord.  I tested it and it seemed to work fine but it's too big for travel, even with the handle folded.  The price was good so I may keep it as a back up to my regular hair dryer but now I need to look for a smaller one for my suitcase.
I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful. I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don't even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush. Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it, but I don't recommend if you actually want to style it using the blow dryer.
I purchased this dryer to replace a 3-year-old Andis dryer that stopped working, and this one feels heavier, isn't as easy to use, and is not at all suitable for travel.  The heat and blower buttons are on two different panels, which some may like for the different possible combinations of settings but which I find difficult to adjust.  I'll keep it to use as a spare, but it's particularly disappointing because it was more expensive than my old dryer.
ok
shiny hair less frizz... same drying time.
Not very compact for a travel device.
Tiny, almost toy like. Decided to stick it in the cabinet for an emergency backup.
I live at altitude in Colorado, and hair dryers can feel rather weak because there is less air to push through. This dryer is shaped for optimal delivery of air, and the airflow volume feels as powerful at altitude as most similarly priced consumer hair dryers at sea level. The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer packable for travel. I've been happy with this dryer for 9 months until today. I'm reducing the rating by 2 stars because the power switch failed and the only way to turn off the dryer is to unplug it. Could be worse, at least it still runs!
Bought this because I wanted a retracting cord, and so many reviews RAVED about the dryer itself.  After using it for a few weeks, I can say the drier is fine BUT<br />1) 3 speeds with 1 temp each (you can't go medium heat, high speed, for example - it's low/low, med/med, or high/high<br />2) the cord doesn't fully retract, even with some jiggling.  It retracts enough for my purposes (I leave it plugged in under my sink, and drop the unit in a basket)<br />3) it's kind of noisy, but does dry hair fast so overall exposure is probably less
I bought this hairdryer for an upcoming trip and wanted something compact yet efficient.  After several uses, the cord stopped retracting all the way, and instead, only goes in about 2/3 of the total length.  I expected this to happen eventually although I was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner.  So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.
I like the hair dryer it dries my hair pretty quickly but never burns. The concentrator works well which is very important to me as this attachment is the key to straight and smooth hair. The only negative is the placement of the control buttons. The on/off button and temperate button are in opposite order of all my previous hair dryers so it takes getting use to.
Good for about 6 months, then burn out.
Works as described but not the strongest dryer we have had.  Good for the money but don't expect tons of heat.
Loved this hair dryer, but just after a year of use, it just stopped working. Was really bummed!
I would give it a higher rating but the cord is just too short. Other than that, it works fine and I like the flat black finish.
The blow dryer died after six months.  It just completely stopped working.
Heavy, big and burned out within 10 months of light use.
Doesn't blow as hard as I was hoping :(. With long, thick hair, it takes a while to dry
I thought it would be smaller, for traveling.
not as powerful as i would have liked.  dislike the on/off switch location.
It overheats on high after a little more than a minute of use - disappointing
Shipment took a while to get to its destination.  I was expecting a professional mini dryer specially the air difussor... bummer.. this is just like the ones that i could purchase in any department store.
It works wery well but it is covered by a kind of rubber that glues dust and loose hair.
Read the reviews and someone mentioned the cord is too short.  I agree.  It's doable but I have to watch that I don't turn around or move too far from the outlet.  Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it's because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  The cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste - I prefer the lighter model.  My sister has the same one and after a while the button to reel the cord in broke.
I purchased this unit a little over a year ago and had about 10 months of service using once a day for less than 5 minutes. It is an inexpensive unit and frankly did not expect it to last much longer. The unit fell to the floor from counter height 3 times.......on the third, the fan (a fragile clear acrylic plastic part) shattered and lost two blades. It is so imbalanced that it will now not, nor should it, run. I am disappointed at the overall quality as I feel it should have been able to withstand such impact. It is inexpensive however, and the moral holds true.......I'll look for a better unit next time.
As a guy, I didn't think I would have much use for a hair dryer. But since I'm an adult now (self-diagnosed) my barber said that I should upgrade my haircut and hair product. This now requires me to dry my hair out of the shower. For me, this hair dryer works fine. I just need a quick dry in the morning before I put in hair stuff, so it's just fine for that. If you are a lady (or guy) with a lot of hair, this might not be the dryer for you. It's not super powerful, even on high, and is overall pretty cheap (look at the price.) It's nice if you just need something to get by and don't want to spend a lot of money.
The top doesn't move that well so it's a little crazy trying to get it adjusted on your clients head, knobs feel cheap also
It's ok, powerful, but the hot setting is TOO HOT and you can't turn it down much.
For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected. It's just okay.
Packs power for its size but the plastic gets very warm and seems like it could be a hazard after prolonged use.
Basic dryer ,no expectations beyond the one you had previously
I like it, but I have trouble keeping the bonnet attached to the hose.
The dryer arrived in good condition due to being carefully wrapped.  It was exactly as described.  The only thing I found that was<br />a slight  negative is that it is heavier than I expected.
This hair dryer is not as strong as I was hoping.  It's ordinary.  It was cheap enough so I won't bother returning it.
Good Hair Dryer.  Nice weight, cord good length.  I just had to get used to the button location, it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally.
Lacks essentiel qualities like adjustability of the height, temperature. Gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides.
It's cheap, not that great. Not professional but it will work for probably  a year or two.  The buttons are not good because they are plastic sliders, and will probably break first.  I notice no anti frizz with this versus what I had with a professional one that broke before.
It most definitely is not this color or this size, but it's easy to travel with and it work.
It performes as expected.  My problem with it is it's size.  I would never have purchased it if I had any idea how large it is.  It is so long that my arm is almost not long enough to keep from hitting myself in the head when drying my hair.
Not as much power as expected; cool-shot button is same temp as lowest heat setting. Thought it would be cooler like it was on my previous hair-dryer.
I haven't had the chance to use it yet, but it seems average as far as quality.
It didn't last long. Suddenly died with no warning after no abuse and minimal use. Disappointed - Planned obsolescence!!  Things dont last very long anymore. Aren't made or built to last like years back!!
Its not terrible dryer.  My only issue is that they listed &#34;Adjustable Height Control&#34; as a feature but YOU CANT ADJUST!!!!!!!! False advertisement.  I wouldnt have purchased it if there wasnt a way to control the height.
This is the second one of these I've ordered. I used my old one for a while, although I thought it would last longer. I blow dry my hair a couple nights a weeks, and it started making a burning chemical smell about a year or 2 after I bought it. It does dry pretty fast however, so I ordered another one.
The problem I have with this product is that even with a medium heat, the comb attachments melt. There is no warning on the manual whatsoever on what heat stand should be used in order to prevent the comb attachments from melting. I am grateful to Amazon for replacing my damaged items
Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.<br />Update ; I had to take it down as it came down all too often :(. It didn't hold for any reason that I can fathom :( !!!
Doesn't fit with diffuser of twin turbo 2600. Not a noticeable significant upgrade in power either form 2600.
Its not bad for the price
Takes quite some time to dry longer hair.
I like it, it dries my hair quickly. However, I have long, wavy hair, and it gets caught easily in the fan of the dryer (ouch.) I wouldn't necessarily recommend this dryer for curly hair, even with the diffuser my hair gets pretty frizzy and falls flat.
It gets the job done quickly and effectively, for an old man who has little hair left.
It dries hair great. Wish I would have paid attention that you can't adjust the heat. You can only turn it on low or high.
It works magic for my gf thats why I bought one for myself too. My hair is thick so it doesnt work as well as I expected but if you are medium or thin hair it is definitely the one for you
looking for something smaller than this to travel with.
cost more than in regular store....should have check around other place instead on one store before I bought this one<br /><br />
I am an African American women with thick 4B/4C natural hair.  I bought this after reading some good reviews and I have to say it wasn't that great for me.  I thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn't have the blowing power I expected and didn't blow my hair out as straight as I am used to.  The heat settings were just ok also. I almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest I much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair.  The comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily.  Overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price.  I'm actually returning mine to get something better.
There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord. I babied this thing, but the retractable cord stopped functioning after several months. The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer. It dries my hair, but plenty of other cheaper models would do that just as well.
The motor whines slightly & the &#34;coating&#34; on the body is flaking.  I do like the heat it can put out. I like the rubber &#34;bumper&#34; spots they have around. Cord is just long enough for me but I also knew length before ordering.
If you are looking for a dual voltage travel this is not the one. I'm not sure if it works well, I returned it because it wasn't dual.
So glad to have a hair dryer that had a good range of temperatures.  And so much less noisy that my old dryer.  But the location of the buttons make it difficult to hold.  And the high speed does not work unless I press down on the top of that button. I will keep it, but am disappointed.
It is quite larger and heavier than I anticipated. I know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower, it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself.  Other than that it is a great hair dryer.
I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now.
This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  The extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver.  Heat is OK not real hot.  I would recommend for home use only.
There is definitely potential to overheat.  At least that's what it smells like, so I don't use the hottest setting, but it is very quiet
The hair dryer performance is very good.  The cord is a problem.  While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  Often when I use it, it stalls because of the pulling on the cord at the plug outlet.
Can dry and style my coarse hair quickly especially with the special straightener attachment without too much fuss and effort
Very good buy for the price my only complaint is the timer is also the power knob.  When the dryer is on it ticks the entire time which gets annoying after awhile especially that one of the awesome feature is the dryer itself is very quiet.
The dryer has a major design flaw.  The control switches are where your hand goes so while drying my hair, I kept on having to constantly adjust the speed or temp setting.  It's very annoying.  I do like the fact they have a cool setting so I can use it to blow dry my puppies after they get a bath but I am thinking seriously about returning it because of the switch problem.
... of blow-styling, but it is a bit heavy. You wouldn't want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.
It's a good dryer, but it am downgrading it for not being brand new. The item we received was an open item, with signs of usage. The package was not sealed and the manual was missing.
The main reason I bought this hair dryer 2 years age, it's because it was advertised as being quiet. (I can't stand noisy hair dryers) and although it's not as quiet as I expected, it is quieter than all of the other ones I've bought.  It's has great power, it's light, easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny.  2 Weeks ago it started to fail, I couldn't turn it off, so I'd just unplug it, but this morning it completely stopped working.  So over all, I think I did get my money's worth, because I blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min, so the price is really good vs. the quality. I even bought another one just now.  Hope this helps.
Great powerful not too noisy dryer for about a year, then it loses power.  Even at this price, I expect a blow dryer to last longer than a year of home use by one person.
It is ok..But I thought might be more powerful..but does the job for me since my hair is not very thick.  has some good<br />attachments also..fairly priced.
I've been through 3 of this model dryer and each stopped working within 1 year.  Time to switch to another company. It's too bad because I really liked everything else about it.
My wife liked it after they sent the necessary parts to assemble the hood. It may be a bit noisy but, it's okay.
I had not purchased a hair dryer in 14 years; I was still using my Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen hair dryer from my youth.  Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it's nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don't think you're going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi's.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.  I have very long and thick hair, and unfortunately, the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one I chose to use 14 years ago.
for the size of the dryer, it's quite heavy and there is no attachment for the end of the dryer to direct flow.  less than ideal.
It can't be used as hot as I wished.  Seems that the engine would not bear the temperature.  Design is clean and I like it.
i had this exact model for like 3 years. my husband bought this for me online bc it was finally dying on me. but this one...idk its not as powerful as my old one. and im literally in the bathroom ten minutes longer trying to get my hair dry.
The dryer does an adequate job, but doesn't seem to generate the same level of heat that my previous 1875 watt dryer did. The attachment to direct the air flow also doesn't seem to work as well. I have been using this dryer for about six months, so I think I have had it plenty of time to get used to, but still I don't like it as well as my previous one.
I really need one of these that goes from 1/4-1 inch barrel as I have very short layered hair I need to and volume and height to and turn curlers to soft waves.  I do not want it straight.
The original sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer was much better.  It was smaller and easier to use.  This is ok since I can't find the original
Just because a hair dryer is pretty and sturdy does not mean I like it. It's very loud and very heavy. Also it's very powerful. I have natural curly hair and even with the diffuser it's too powerful and makes may hair frizz. I will be trying the Conair Curl Fusion Ionic<br />Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer because I heard it's better for curly hair and not as heavy or loud.
Small and light weight. Quiet, relative to our old one which was loud through the bathroom door. On low fan speed, it's very quiet, especially with the bathroom door closed. Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one. Black one is 22 bucks for some reason.  UPDATE: After ~14 months, the on/off switch started to malfunction. It's sticky and engages sometimes but mostly doesn't. Knocking off a star from 4-star to 3-star. This apparently is a common complaint. I took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and I haven't found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated. For the price, I'll probably just buy another because it's what works best for us in terms of power, quiet and weight.
This is an excellent hair dryer and a well-made product.  However, be advised:  The owner's manual/manufacturer's warranty included with the product--and the manufacturer's web site--both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from Amazon.
I would really like the hose to be longer.  If you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet.  You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.  The dryer on hot gets way too hot.  Even on medium it gets very hot.  I've wound up using it on the cool setting.  One good thing- the bonnet really is a nice big one.
What can you say--it is a good product and does exactly what I wanted.  There are no bells and whistles, but I'm traveling.  I wanted something collapsable and easy to carry.  Although it's a tiny bit larger than I had hoped for, it is still better than my at home dryer.
This is a little dryer, but for the price, it should offer more. For example, the air flow seems to come out of the unit at a strange angle. I've used the dryer for several weeks and I still haven't figured out how to make the most of the air. The temperature of the air is fine, and velocity is as expected for a 1600 watt unit, the direction is off. I was a bit disappointed by the knob to switch the voltage. You need a coin to turn the selection, and the plastic is so cheap that it was immediately, and permanently, gouged. If this unit cost $10, like some at Target, I would expect that, but this is priced in a way that one expects better quality. I don't think I'd buy this unit again.
Difficult to find a hair dryer with a brush anymore.  Very well made but much larger and clumsy to hold than the one it replaced.
The retractable cord, the compact size, and the power are awesome! So is the price! It just needs a proper nozzle!
ORDERED FOR Y WIFE. SHE SAYS IT HAS LOTS OF POWER AND DRIES WELL. THE ADAPTER THING IS TO SMALL. MOTOR IS GOOD AND ALL THAT. SHE WONT ORDER AGAIN DUE TO THE SMALL ADAPTER.
The hair dryer itself is a great dryer for the price. I had owned one for 6 years before it broke. So I bought another one. But this one is a revised model of the original one I bought when these first came out. And they have considerably shortened the length of the cord. Very bad for  salon use or if your outlet is more then two feet away. Other then that I have no complaints about this product.
The hose needs to be a little bit longer. Heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose.
I bought this to replace one that burnt out on me. This one is much bulkier and longer than previous one so I'm constantly hitting myself in the head. It will take some time to get use to.
Won't return this, but it seems a little wobbly and doesn't work particularly well with my beth room outlets.  The folding mechanism doesn't seem to lock the the unfolded position.  Good power and blowing temps.
My old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use; I was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer. I looked for another one just like it but to no avail.  I found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find, I purchased 2. I no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days, (and my hair is shorter) SO I expected it to last longer than 9 months. Today when I turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when I went to turn off the unit, the on/off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area. I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit. Now I am apprehensive on using the second one I purchased. For 25.00 each, I would have expected it to last longer.<br /><br />As for drying my hair, it was a good hair dryer.
We purchased the black travel model while we were traveling because our old Conair went on the blink. Had to get it from Target. It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc. Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting. Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &#34;Folding Handle&#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL. It's available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.
The dryer is working fine so far. There's no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than I would like. I move it around with care and support it with both hands. For the price I expected to be so. In the future, if I adapt to it, I might fiddle with the design and make it more stable. Do not expect wonders.
I had read all the reviews for this hairdryer and was super excited to try it out. Sadly, I don't see what all the hype is about. While it gets the job done (i.e. dries my hair), I did not notice any substantial reduction in drying time. Nor did my hair become shinier from the tourmaline. I'll continue to use this until it dies, but will not repurchase as a $40 conair dryer works just as well.
Overall this hairdryer does the job well; its 1875 and powerful will dry hair quickly.  I have two issues with this dryer:  1.  the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when I'm drying my hair; its really irritating and 2.  the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where I usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because I dont want the cool shot button on to I have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle.
Good price on this dryer with the excellent option of a built in cord reel.  We will see how long that holds up.  Couple of issues I disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy, wish it was a bit quieter, and also doesn't seem like the air blows very hot.  Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.
until it stopped working (the nightlight still worked but the hair dryer would not turn on again) after a year of use. couldn't get through to anyone on the phone. finally had to return it and try another brand...
You kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment, and that I would get it on the estimated date.  I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out--I could have had it sooner.  My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!
It blow drys my hair pretty well. However, it is heavy. I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it. With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it's so heavy. I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers. Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn't as heavy.
Thie texture on this dryer feels nice, but it's much heavier than my last one. It hasn't gotten &#34;sticky&#34; as some have noted, but I've only used it for a few weeks. It comes with a tiny diffuser, which was good, because my diffuser doesn't fit it. I wish I could get a larger one, but I'll have to look at an after market one - I'll probably have to take the dryer with me to make sure it will stay on. The dryer is pretty quiet and powerful, which is nice.<br /><br />One of the things I would change is the location of the buttons. I never fail to change the speed or heat when I'm using it. I use a stronger grip on it due to the weight, so it's easier for me to hit a button on accident.<br /><br />I wouldn't &#34;not&#34; recommend it, but I would suggest to keep looking a little bit more.
My husband uses the hairdryer a lot more than I do. He does not care for the way it works and the lack of settings. He is considering replacing it or removing it altogether.
This does dry my hair.  It is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair!
I like this product. I really like being able to change the heat settings. My only complaint is that the controls are in the same place as my hand so I sometimes inadvertently change the settings.
I have normal to fine long hair, and while this dryer has dramatically shortened my drying time, my biggest issue is that it turns my dried hair into a tangly mess. A hairbrush literally rips my hair out after drying. I haven't had this issue with a dryer before, and an at-home coconut oil treatment has helped the situation somewhat, so I've decided to keep the dryer until my next haircut to see if that alleviates the tangles. If not, I will probably buy a new dryer.
This hair dryer did not deliver the turbo drying that I wanted.  It takes too long to dry my hair.
I did love this hair dryer.  Ordered it in Jul 2013.  It is now March 2014 and only the slow speed works.  The other two don't. I know hair dryers are a somewhat disposable item.  But come on, didn't even last a year?
We orde our 2nd hairdryer because same spot in the bathroom-hholes already.<br /><br />But the drer doesnt last , 1. Year
I purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews.  I thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too.  I did not use the dryer so I can't review how well it works.  The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my 'home' hair dryer & that is why I returned it.
Works pretty well, but I've been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer‚Ä?which I didn't have to do before, but now if I don't, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.
The description says a diffuser is included but it is not in the box.<br />Heavy for person with arthritis.<br />Not so quiet.
I broke my wife's Babyliss TT 3000 dryer (guess they don't bounce), so I had to buy her a replacement.  She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.
I bought this dryer specifically because the handle could collapse and the cord was retractable, which I thought would make it fit in my drawer.  Both features work well but, it still wouldn't fit in the drawer.  This dryer does not get very hot so it takes longer to dry my hair than my previous one.  However, it was a good price and you get what you pay for.  I'll keep it but I would try another model before I bought this again.
I find it to be very high volume of air but the heat is low. The difuser snaps on poorly
I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  I guess I will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord :(
I appreciate it's light weight; however the &#34;High&#34; speed is much too powerful and quite loud.  I've put it aside as a travel or emergency hair dryer.
Heavy and stopped working after . Worked well on my hair though but it was too heavy and didnt last long!
I have it and use it when I needed (usually for my bangs) I don't like how it stiffens my hair when I blow dry it. I like the real thing when I blow dry my long thick hair...
I bought this for the retractable cord. Hadn't bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don't need one much. But I got tired of having to wind up the cord all the time after I used my old small dryer for a minute. This dryer is meant for a serious blow dryer, I think. Someone who has a lot of hair and needs drying power. Be aware that this machine is big and heavy. I don't need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized. Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter. With a retractable cord.
This really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things.  It doesn't get hot enough and it's missing a cold shot button.  The air flow is perfect, I love the different speeds and heat settings, how it feels, the lenth of the cord, etc... It just doesn't get hot enough to straighten/smooth the hair like my CHI did, even at its hottest setting.  I need to flat iron afterwards (my hair has a medium natural wave).  I love the way the Elchim is made, so I'm going to try different models to see if they have what I'm looking for.
The dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with.  This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  Suddenly smoke came out.  I turned it off, vacuumed the lint that wasn't very bad.  Flipped the red safety switch.  Nothing worked.  I'm really bummed.
this is a quality hair dryer, no doubt about that. But in my search to replace an old and cheap one, i didn't consider the size and weight of these newer, salon quality ones. Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features. The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only 'unbearably hot' on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that's something to get used to, but didn't seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn't fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit.
I probably do not need all this power, but there is a low setting so that makes it better.  It fits my space very well
This was easy to assemble. It feels sturdy. Everything works as it should. The only drawback is that all the air blows from the top, not the sides, so my hair dries unevenly. Also, the hood is rather long and skinny, so there isn't much room to move or use curlers, if you ever wanted to.
Other reviews stated it was to hot.  Not for me. Gets warm but I could not call it hot.<br /><br />Recommend
This hairdryer isn't as powerful as I thought it would be. I have cheaper ones from Target that blow more air. I got it for the cool air switch and it does work fine.
This dryer has good air velocity, but the air isn't as warm as I would like it to be. Also it has a higher pitch whine than I would have expected for a dryer of this size. I have a little portable dryer and this one sounds almost identical. I do love the retractable cord. It's nice not having a bunch of loose cord everywhere. I also like that it folds down to a smaller size for packing away.
I have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it, I like to use a diffuser, a low fan setting and a mid heat setting.  This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &#34;warm&#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &#34;hot&#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  The &#34;hot&#34; setting is what it claims to be and can be downright scalp scalding.  I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot, I appreciate it when I'm straightening my hair, but the &#34;warm&#34; setting is insufficient for my needs.<br /><br />Other than that, the hair dryer is great, the attachments work well (the condenser doesn't spin like I've had happen on other hair dryers) the retractable cord doesn't have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.
makes hair straight but oh my god. it plugs out every 5 seconds.
I had to return this dryer because it was too heavy for me.  I thought my strong, volleyball playing daughter might want it, but she also said it was too heavy. Powerful enough but too heavy.
This is the first time that I've spent over $30 for a hair dryer. I was really looking forward to using this. I have had this hair dryer for 1 month, and I have to say that my biggest complaint is the nozzle attachment keeps falling off which is very aggravating.  Other than that I love how quick it dries my hair, and it does make my hair look more smoother.  I have thick wavy curly frizzy hair.
I read the previous reviews commenting on how quiet it is, but I was disappointed to see that it also meant it was lacking power to dry hair quickly. I don't understand the negative ion feature but it doesn't seem to make a difference. The hair dryer is ok, but I wouldn't have bought it knowing what I know now.
I was in the market for a new hair dryer after my previous one gave out after a few years.  I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and the low price.<br /><br />This one is suitable, but I'm going to keep looking for a new one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It increased my drying time (I previously had an inexpensive Revlon)<br />- Even on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot<br />- It is a bit on the heavy side<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The retractable cord is great for storage
I've had this hairdryer for a year and a half.  I love the settings and how quickly it dries my hair.  It didn't last as long as I'd hoped, however.  It just started popping and shooting fire out of the end.
It is nice and compact, however not showing in the description on-line is that it will only run in low speed when using the 220 voltage.  This wouldn't work with my hair therefore I had to return it.
This is an ordinary hair dryer, and it works fine.  Not too heavy or inconvenient in any way except those switches which are kind of &#34;fiddly.&#34;  They have a loose, cheap feel, but it's not really a big problem.
What I really hate is the strong bell when the timer is over..right in your ears, not fun at all.
While preparing for a few weeks in Europe, my girlfriend mentioned bringing her hair dryer. I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn't have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you're there, and you'll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.
Only lasted about a year and then burned up.  It is only used once a day or so and you would think it should last longer.
The retractable cord is already stalling out on me and I just got the hair dryer.  It works great but don't expect miracles with the cord.
We were using Japanese brand Hair Dryer before this but it broke so we had to get another one. I don't know it's all american brand or what but this thing is soooo loud!! I was watching video on my laptop in the next door and I could not hear the video even with max volume. It does dry the hair up real nice but it just really LOUD!! We were just so used to Japanese brand high quality quiet hair dryer, this thing is a monster. If you don't care about the loudness, go for it. It does work like it advertise. As a dryer works awesome!
It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud. Also there are 2 speeds but heat isn't adjustable--lower speed means less heat.
Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  I gave it to my mom since it's small and very light and she doesn't have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  Still searching for a good hair blower...
The product itself is a 4 - 5 star product. It is just right for my wife's needs and the night light is a welcome plus. The 3 stars was for installation. I found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security. I drilled the holes. Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through. I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole. Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company. Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall. I hope it is fixed in the future. If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.
I am my 3rd of 4th one of these. In my experience, they usually last about 1-3 years of daily use before it dies and you have to buy a new one. It doesn't do anything fantastic for my hair, but it gets the job done. It is the only one that I have found on the market that has a retractable cord, and for that reason alone I continue to buy these. This time however, the cord stopped retracting about two months of using it, so that was really unfortunate :( Will continue to buy until I find something better at a decent price with a retractable cord!
The power is not great. It takes twice the time to dry my hair as with a standard hair dryer with a diffuser attachment
I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls. The cord did not retract well into the base. Maybe should of been a little lighter in weight. still all in all worked well enough for the price.
I like this unit after reading product description. I ordered it. I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.<br /><br />When I received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package, I came to know I can not use this product with extension wires or with voltage converters. So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(
I purchased it hoping to get that salon blowout look. I was disappointed when it worked the exact same a my old $15 dollar hair dryer.
The Handle is too big for me also heavy but I like folding handle ,retractable  code and affordable price! So I gotta  say it's ok !
This hair dryer works well, however, after about a year or so of use, the clear plastic coating around it, has started to peel off. This speaks to the quality of the materials used. It still works and I still use it but just wanted to mention that. It is pretty light, which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry! The main reason I purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands.
i bought this for my daughter.. she said the heat is good, but the blower is weak. she has long thick hair and it wasn't doing the job... she plans on keeping it though-she is cutting her hair short and feels it will work fine on shorter hair.
I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use
This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful. It was rather bigger than I expected from the image though.
my hair dryer died after 1 year, very disappointed This is the second one from Conair that this happened to, the other died after 6 months. Going to try a different brand
I loved this hairdryer while it lasted, it had a lot of power, was not terribly loud, and dried my long hair quickly. However, with no warning one recent day it just stopped blowing hot air. Only cold air blows out of the unit now.
The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.  My only question that was not in with instructions, when would I use the &#34;Negative Ion&#34; setting or the &#34;Regular Ion&#34; setting.
Good, light weight dryer. Would be perfect if the attachment would stay in place. Dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place
The product works fine, it just has a broken ring on the end of the drier so if you wanted to use the defuser, you can't.
I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so. For the cost of the dryer I would have like directions to running the dryer. I have no idea what the difference is between Negative ions or neutral ions. This would be helpful since its all about the ions! Overall I feel like it is a good dryer just wish it had done all it was supposed to do for the price!
After 15 minutes of constant operation the connection betwee. The two parts started melting. Other than that everything else is pretty satisfying.
I like the fact this dryer is light which is great however it is very loud and I have to use earplugs because of the noise level.  It does a great job drying and styling hair.  I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.
Base does not fit flat to the wall because of protruding round head screws on back of base. Remove screws before installation. One of these screws had broken it's plastic receiver anyway and was holding nothing. Mounting hardware (1 screw) missing and too small<br />to hold securely anyway. No mounting instructions. No drywall mollies. I actually like the dryer itself. Nice thick cord, decent power on high.  Low setting on the dryer is totally useless . If your handy like me you can make the installation work for a perfect fit.
This dryer is a bit larger than I expected but is very lightweight. I have a couple minor issues : there is no 'loop' attached to hang up the dryer and the cord is about a foot too short for my taste. It DOES dry my hair however, so all in all, it does the job.
This hair dryer works well but it is larger and heavier than I expected and my hair seems to get caught in it a bit. I would have liked it better were it much lighter weight and smaller.
My plans were to replace my travel hairdrier with this one but this one was bigger than mine.  The advantage I found is the noise. This hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important.  Would not work for me.  If size is not an issue this is a good purchase.
Did not last that long had to replace it with another brand. The heat element died too soon I thought.
It has plenty of power and dries my hair quite well. The problem is that it seems to short out and I have to reset the fuse constantly. Perhaps it is overloading my circuit. But my old one never had this problem.
I love this dryer but have gone through two in the last year. I always use the defuser with it and the defuser attachment ALWAYS falls off (about 30 times during a blow dry). This dryer works well on frizz when the defuser is staying on, but it is extremely frustrating to constantly stop and reattach it.
I have both this model and the 1600 watt hair dryer.  They are the same size but the difference is very noticeable.  go with the 1600 one.
I like the nozzle attachment, but it can fall off easily which can get annoying.  It has 2 levels of heat settings and 2 levels of cool blow dry settings so that is good, and it is not heavy.  But I recently used a friend's Conair Infinity hairdryer and I actually liked that much better, it dried my hair in less time and it was less frizzy....
It does the job but I find it a little bit heavy to hold. For the rest it is OKAY.<br /><br />Joanne
this is kind of bulky but as long as your not traveling with it it's OK, not a lot of velocity but it gets your hair dry in a decent amount of time
Not as powerful as others led me to believe. However, it is cute and very easy to travel with. It will be a staple in my suitcase from now on.
It's not exactly lightweight, but it's also not a compact dryer. I find the weight to be average. However, I find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high. On the lower speed, it is warm. And, hot is a bit too hot.
Mine malfunctions. A lot of times when I turn it on to low, it comes on on high and after a few seconds switches to low.
It's okay, but not the best. i was looking to spend less than 20 $ on it, for the money, it's okay, but it is not the best.
Ok hair drying but the heat setting don't quite work perfectly. The hot setting on high air setting messes up my curls a little, but the hot setting on low air doesn't get hot enough. other than that it is great for travel and unlike a lot of the reviews about the cord retraction  problem I didn't find that a problem, you just need to pull it out all the way and hold the button steady for it to gain momentum. Sometimes I have to help it with the last inch or two. but definitely it's not a big issue. what more can you expect from a tiny motor of this size. I would rather have this than a good motor that would also make the hair dryer heavier.<br />I am happy with what I have got for this price, I still think as far as travel dryers go this the best one I have seen so far.
I expect to get more than 15 months out of a hairdryer, especially since I travelled for work about 30% of the time and didn't bring this hairdryer with me.  This hairdryer replaced the Blackbird, which lasted over 3 years.  I liked that this dryer was powerful and hot.  It dried my hair quickly, and I had no problems blowing my very wavy hair out straight.  I'd love to get another one, but am trying a BaByliss this time in the hopes that it will last longer.
It is too heavy for me.  I gave it to my neice and ordered a T3 featherweight because it is lighter
I am a hairdresser of 40+ years...needed this for my very occasional jobs at home...it will do the job...easy to store (biggest reason for this choice, over one on wheels)  Somewhat noisy (who cares) WONDERFUL heat...could use some more air holes.  This is not made as good as the one I had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old...but that is true about everything...can't see how it adjusts in height
It is not very powerful! Takes a while to blowdry, not as bad for men as for women.. But it hangs conveniently on the wall!
I bought two just over a year ago and have had both of them fail after what I think is a short period of time.  My wife loves the way it dries her hair and she likes that they are mounted on the wall.  I ordered two more this time based on, in my opinion, the short length of time before failure only because my wife likes it.
THIS HAIR DRYER IS EXTREMELY HEAVY. IT IT ALSO VERY HOT AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRY YOUR HAIR ON HIGH.  I HAVE ACTUALLY SAW MY HAIR SPARK WHEN DRYING. SO PLEASE USE CAUTION.
A little noisy, not like my previous pro dryer, but it drys my hair. The little air diffuser doesn't stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....there's nothing to keep it connected. Dumb construction.
The air coming out of dryer is room temperature at best and the cord rewind does not work. The cord only rewinds part of the way.<br />The only feature left to work is the folding handle.  That works fine.
I like this blow dryer except for several issues.  I have short hair so use the low speed setting mostly. It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  Then it's loud.  It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  If you have long, thick hair this would be pretty heavy to use for any length of time.  The diffuser has very hard plastic fingers. Wish they'd make soft, pliable ones that would be more comfortable to lift and twist hair. The retractable cord is a great feature and works well if you follow the instructions.
When the description said 2 speeds and 3 heat setting I was thinking that I could use them in any combination. NOPE .... there are 3 choices ... low, med, and high and the heat settings are preset.<br /><br />I also with that it had a cold blast button.<br /><br />However, I like the size and the fact that it stays out of the way so I kept it.
No complaints on functionality but it is WAY bigger and heavier then I expected based on my previous cord-keeper folding handle Conair.  I supose I should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but I guess I assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around.  If you own a seperate hair dryer for travel, this could be a good option.  I think it would be best for the teen age crowd, it is awfuly pink too.
If you're looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows &#34;luke warm&#34; air, then this is the one to get. But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won't do it for you.
Kind of heavy, cord sometimes doesn't roll up all the way, not very powerful but my hair is soft when using it.
The hair dryer came to me without the brush attachment. I tried to obtain the brush even if I had<br />to pay for it. The seller was  not  helpful at all in me getting the attachment.
This dryer works fine, it does just what I wanted. The color is quite pink, and it's very small, almost like a toy. Smaller than I thought it would be. It would be really nice for a young girl. It will be great for traveling too. It serves the purpose for me and works fine.
After received, I was shocked.<br />Very heavy.<br />Thanks to the wind. Soon blow dry my hair.<br />But I don't have to buy and try other brands of products in the United States.
Open box Part missing, Not new as advertised You get what you pay for Wason the verge of returning product Hope I don't regret it
So the bad news is that it doesn't get as hot as I would prefer.  It barely gets the job done and I'm a guy w/ short thinning hair.  I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/ this dryer.<br /><br />The +'s are that it's simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord & has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.
For drying hair it does work very well and does not give off ozone, which is good if you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Believe it or not, but another ionizing hair dryer caused my eyes to water and wheezing. I could barely sleep until my girlfriend happened across some information that said the ionizing hair dryers can cause this. When she purchased this hair dryer my asthma problems stopped. Unfortunately, I have to knock several stars off this product because the on/off switch has already failed, which was pretty disappointing.
Dogs to work as well as my hand held  Conair and doesn't have button to stop heat and just blow air .  Disappointed in the functions .  Steve allen
I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size. However, after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times, the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220. I figured I'd just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay. But a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand.
I bought this in late August 2012. I take very good care of my hair products and this barely lasted a year. Recently it has overheated very quickly and today it went out and started smoking from the inside and through the cord. Pretty disappointing that it didn't last more than a year but you get what you pay for.
It is not light weight, and does not blow dry hair fast. The only thing it has going for it is it's quieter than the one I have.<br />I was looking for a good lightweight blow dryer. It does not compare to the T3
I owned the model before this one for about 8 years. It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

No issues with light (some people mentioned it died).. been working OK for almost a month now.<br />Does the job and does it quite well.. quite powerful and dries hair well.. Now for the price its great! the reason I bought this particular one was because I used it at a hotel and liked the product..<br />Now the reason for 3 stars:<br />The quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior, feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months, the first one I had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so I returned it and got another piece from amazon (easy (and free) return I should say!). But the fact that its quite plastic-ey and the second one I received had the same dent (just smaller) so the finishing is not that great... but I should add it works and does what it should efficiently! I think i would give it 5 stars if it was $5 more expensive but was better quality/finishing..
My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  I've let it air out for days and it still smells..  It's a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  I've own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.
Seems slow to blow. Works okay otherwise. Not a lot of power compared to my much less expensive dryer that lasted 6 years. I should have replaced it with the same one but went with reviews I saw on Amazon about this dryer. Live and learn.
I'll be under there forever and when I get out my hair is still not dry. Maybe it's my hair but I'm nor 100% satisfied.
Works like a decent dryer, but I didn't see any improvement in frizz-control. I have very thick, frizzy 2A hair, and this dryer could get my hair mostly dry in under ten minutes.<br /><br />The retractable cord is nice, as is the defuser.
Not very travel friendly.  I was hoping that it would fold up.. it doesn't.  It works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer.
The unit does the job of drying hair just fine, but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable.
don't like the  attachments, which is what I bought it for.  the brush is flimsy.  the handle design makes styling difficult.
It's ok.  I was disappointed in how big it turned out to be.  I was hoping it would be closer to a travel size.  The diffuser is too big for me....but I decided to keep it regardless.
I'm not that impressed. I didn't notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair. And it's heavier than my old dryer. However I did notice that my hair does look smoother.
I had a small travel hair dryer that finally broke after many years of use. i looked on line for a similar one but the Conair was the only one that folded so I though it might be the same size. it was not. Great for home but too large for travel.
Much bigger than expected. I was looking to replace a tiny yet powerful hair dryer. This one is not as compact as it appears.
Have owned 4 of the 30125 model units, I like the small size and heat ranges.<br />Andis support (unit replacement )when required has been in less than a week, no questions asked.<br />The high low switch is somewhat prone to failure which has occurred at least twice in the last four years; otherwise this model is quite reliable.
I was expecting this blow dryer to be hot really hot but it's not. I don't know maybe is just me<br />that thinks that way. It gets the job done so I shouldn't be complaining.
I like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot, it's brain boiling!  Use with extreme caution!
This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  The only complaint that I have is that it is heavy to hold after a while.
This dryer might work wonderfully.  I wouldn't know.  It arrived and I opened it and was shocked at how big it was.  Much larger than the photo or specs indicated.  Not suitable for travel, but I can't comment on performance.
My previous Conair had more power, I really don't see how this is 1875 however it dries my hair just fine
Conair use to be a great product, and due to the fact of personal use over thirty years of different hair dryers, I purchased this model. The folding andel, and retractable cord were attractive to me, but the dryer did not last a year. I used it every morning for three to five minutes, but everything now a days is built cheap, and doesen't last. Same with this model. Great size for travel, or small storage, but don't expect it to last.
I bought this for the diffuser for traveling.  The air flow is so strong that it doesn't really diffuse very well and my hair ends up being blown all over.  If you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine.
This was the first time I spent  more than $40 for a hair dryer, so I was expecting it to be great. But after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off. However the dryer works well, it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair. I should have returned it. Too much money for an okay hair dryer!
I really like the hangup dryers because they save counter space. I don't like this as much as the  last one I had (when it stopped working I threw it away before writing down the manufacturer so I couldn't reorder it), but I'm sure I'll get used to it. It's heavier than my previous dryer, and I'd really like a setting that's between LOW and HIGH, temperature-wise. Fairly easy to attach to the wall, although the template wasn't of much use.
I upgraded to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get something good based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn't do anything better than previous ones I've owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I've seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven't had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.
This is not as good as the hair dryer I use at home, a Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer. For compact, portable, it is not that small. For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume. My previous portable one was smaller and dried better. This works OK.
After the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months, I bought another since my wife liked the style. When the new one came, it fit the bracket exactly as the first.  The only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one.  Not sure why, but it is annoying, especially in the morning.
A  holder piece  inside o f the holder  broke in a month so I am unable to hang it up anymore. Too late to ask for a replacementWill not purchase anotherfrom this maker..
found it to feel heavy,and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair .Does dry hair quickly is it's good feature
It works fine, but it has a terrible build quality, it feels chinese. But it's a good buy for the price.
I have really thick hair that needs a lot of heat to dry and be styled. I was pretty disappointed right away by the 'hot' setting - didn't feel very hot to me. The only time the air actually felt hot, rather than warm, was when I turned the setting up to 'high' - and then I had to work so fast to dry my hair that if I made a mistake, I would have to wet my hair and start over again! The 'high' setting is no joke, it really moves the air. But I can't use it every day or else I'd look like I just walked out of a wind tunnel.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the switches very easy to use, especially if my hands were even a little damp - was hard to get a good grip (maybe I'm just a weakling?). I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not totally useless, I just had some issues with it. I will say the concentrator and diffuser attachments are great, but with the heat/speed settings, just not a good match for me.
My trusty Hot Tools dryer that I bought from Ulta died on me after two years of daily use...so I decided to get this one given the reviews. This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn't seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools Pink Dragon Ionic Hair Dryer had...it still gets the job done tho...The only thing I'd say sucks is that it doesnt come with a diffuser and the nozzle is an odd oval shape it's not like I can buy a universal diffuser to fit it. =(
I really very much liked this hair dryer while it lasted, which was about 6 months.  If I had written the review earlier, I'd have given it 5 stars.  But, suddenly, the high speed fan stopped working, the low speed works, but it's hotter than it was (which scares me a little).  It gets such great reviews, both on Amazon and Consumer Reports.  But why did it die so soon?  My previous cheep hair dryers have always lasted for years!  Now the best Amazon can offer is approx. 50% refund if I send it back since the 30-day return policy is past.
Blower volume is lower than I wanted and/or  expected. This is not a low line dryer for Andies. Will dry my hair, but will take longer than I wanted it to, so it did not meet my expectations.
Seems like a mostly quality unit but the highest setting still doesn't give you a lot of air speed, just a lot of heat.  The cold shot button is hard to push where it is located, and should have been placed on the opposite side of the handle.  Notice that the fan speed slows and becomes erratic when using the cold shot button, but returns to normal after release.  Unsure how long this unit will last.  Not sure where the &#34;ceramic&#34; part of the dryer comes in since the internals look like a standard heat element setup.  Don't like this as much as the Vidal Sassoon unit that it is replacing.
Had the features I wanted like cool shot and retractable cord. The dimensions are accurate, but unfortunately, it's just a lot bigger and heavier than I expected. Additionally, the folding mechanism and the materials feel pretty cheap, and I'm not certain how long this hairdryer will actually last.
It has no heat selection, only settings of high or low for air flow.  High almost burns my scalp.  Low works but is slower.  Must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting.
We had this dryer for 1 year before it died.  Sadly, it was not heavily used - I usually air dry my long hair and my husband has short hair that takes all of 5 minutes to dry if that.  Initially it defaulted to just one speed.  Unfortunately that was high speed which was such a loud pitch, it hurt our ears to use it.  Not long after that it died altogether.  I'll try another wall mounted dryer, just not Andis.  Too bad they don't make hair dryers as well as they make the Andis clippers I've used for years as a dog groomer.
The retractable cord has become difficult to retract.  This occurred in a relatively short time.  Except for this difficulty, I like the product.
The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair. I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.
The dryer works well for the price, but unfortunately after only a few weeks of use, the button that controls whether the dryer is on/off and the speed came off. I took the dryer apart and set an interior switch to the &#34;high&#34; position so that whenever I plug the dryer in it will turn on at the high speed. I'm not sure if that's safe, but it allows me to continue using the dryer. Since the dryer was so cheap when I bought it (under eight dollars), it's not such a big deal, so I give it three stars.
Its small and mobile but it is not quiet at all. When i purchase a quiet hair dryer all i expect to hear is air blowing. Not the motor at all or even fan for that matter. I have had quieter dryers than this one in the past.
Not using is regularly but its serving the worth of the price. its is small and easy for carrying during the travel.
The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.
After reading all the reviews, it seemed as if this dryer would perform well for my hair type. I have thick, coarse, Asian hair and a lot of it. This dryer is nothing special though. It's not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.<br /><br />Pro: Three heat settings (The fastest speed though is not that powerful)<br /><br />Con: Retractable feature makes the cord quite short.<br /><br />However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.
Loved this hair dryer the first few months I used it until it started cutting off in the middle of drying my hair! My last hair dryer lasted YEARS but this one only lasted about 4 months.
I use this hair dryer every day and I don't feel as if it's doing a &#34;great&#34; drying job.  I previously had a Revlon mini which worked just great.  In any case, will continue to use this one until it dies.
I like the power and feel of this dryer and the ionic conditioning does leave me with less frizz but the cord is too short.  I use an outlet near the floor and I have to use an extension cord or I can't maneuver above my head (and I'm only 5'5&#34;).  If your outlet is counter height it should be fine.
I did a search for &#34;quiet dryers&#34; and this came up.  The reviews sounded ok so I went for it.  It's considerably heavier than the old one I had and definitely stronger.  Overall, it feels like a solid build and does its job with the only complaint being that it's a bit heavier for some (perhaps).  I'd recommend it but have only been using it for 2 weeks.
I was excited to get a &#34;TURBO&#34; Dryer. When I used it for the first time, I was disappointed with the pressure of air flow. I thought it would be more powerful. It is a good hair dryer but not The Greatness, I was expecting.
I like some heat from a hair dryer.  This one has a position that reads &#34;Hot&#34; but, it falls short of that. I'm assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald's coffee while using this hair dryer.  The buttons on the interior of the handle take some getting used to as your grip may have a tendency to change the heat setting or turn it off.  I'm adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part.
When I opened the box i was surprised by how nice it was. It has 3 different levels and the directions even recomend whates better for your hair type. Their is no problem with it its just i thought it would give off more heat. My hair is thick and it took longer than expected for it to dry. I am just gonna use it till it breaks i guess.
This is okay, just not like the one I am use to using, it does the job, sort of but l must air dry my hair first or if I force dry it it becomes fuzzy and I dont like that, other wise it is ok. I was worth the price I guess.
Very functional when it comes to keeping the clutter off the bathroom counter.  However I was disappointed that speed and temperature aren't controlled separately.  My hair gets dry very quickly, but ends up frizzy.
came quick, work fine for about a week now won't suction or stick to any thing. my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him but now it won't, sad.
Not sure whether all &#34;professional&#34; quality hair dryers smell like fumes, but this one does. Other than that, it works fine so far.
This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using
From Amazon's description:  &#34;Guaranteed authentic. Never counterfeit. 4-year warranty.&#34;  When I went to fill out the warranty card it states One (1) year warranty only.  What happened to the other 3 years?  My wife likes it and would rate it 5 stars.
A nice hairdryer, it does what we need. We were disappointed that there was no out of the way storage for any  excess power cord and that the power cord was not coiled to reduce the length of usable cord.<br />It is now three years later, and I must revise this review. I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller<br />blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled. We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.
My experience with this hairdryer is nearly identical to that of a previous reviewer. It's easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years. I'm disappointed--my first thought was to purchase another just like it, but since this appears to be a problem for others as well, I'll look for another solution.
If you are looking for a professional type hair dryer this is a nice one.  It is a bit awkward for me to manuever as I am not used to this type of hair dryer....but the cold air is amazing when you are done drying....
Very heavy and bulky.  Does dry pretty quickly, but really can't tell a big difference from previous dryer.  Not bad, but just okay.
It's just okay, it's kinda loud, but it gets the job done.  I do however prefer the Carel dryer that I had in the past.
Very little frizz and it dries quickly. The dryer is heavier and larger in size than I expected. The control buttons are positioned in a way that your fingers can't avoid them while drying, so the settings are accidentally changed too easily.
I bought a cheaper model elsewhere but my dog chewed  the cord. Liked the other better.  Takes longer to dry hair
I thought it would have more power than it does. I do use it everyday so it is very durable and not cheap by any means
It works fine but I wish it had a hook on the handle so I could hang it up. Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.
Spends most of it's time in my drawer taking up space and collecting dust now.  It is definitely not analogous to having a third arm.
The Revlon works well enough.  It replaces  a Braun (?) machine that shorted out.  The Revlon is larger than I like but that is not a real problem.
Looked nice.  Didn't even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  Need to have dimensions in description.
I have had this dryer for three years to the day and it died. Three years without continuous use doesn't seem very long to me.  Only reason I would purchase the same dryer again is because the mounting hardware etc is already there. Wish it had more power. Takes longer to dry my hair.  Others have complained about the green light - I wish it was blue, but it is nice to have that extra nightlight in the bathroom. LED so it doesn't take much electricity. And I don't sleep in my bathroom so it doesn't bother me.
It's a very powerful hair dryer, which is fine, as I have a lot of hair.  It's not too heavy and there are two settings for low heat and high heat.  However - the retractable cord stopped retracting within 30 days.  And the plug is very clunky - it's something that would be needed in a hair salon, not necessarily your home.  But it was only $14.95 and if it lasts 5 years, I will be happy.  The one that it replaced was a Vidal Sassoon (remember him?) that I bought 15 years ago for about $12.00, so I way got my money's worth out of that!
The dryer was advertised as being much lighter than other models and I can't honestly say I have seen any difference in weight. I like using the dryer as it has several settings that help dry my hair.
I am disappointed tha it is so large; not what I envisioned for a travel dryer. Certainly NOT Mini! Works ok at home.
This is a fast, powerful hair dryer. I have medium length, medium thick hair and this little number works fast without over-drying. The problem? The plug is too loose in the socket. This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short.
I have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output. While this dryer is quiet and lightweight, it did not have any more power than the $20 dryer I was using before. I could not find any wattage/power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual. I am returning it so I cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts.
I have a conair Mini from years ago fits in the palm of my hand .. this one is almost regular size.. I was looking for a very small hair dryer for trips.
Not as powerful as I had hoped; the speeds and temperature control are sufficient. Still takes a while to dry my long hair, so this is not as impressive as some. Still, for the price, it's fine. The true test will be how long it lasts before breaking...
Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn't have to work that hard!  I'm disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.
The one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which I don't like. It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.
I like it but the blow dryer takes a great deal longer to dry my hair and I am unable to adjust the setting so it is on the lowest setting making ti take forever to dry my hair ..
I thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable.  In the end, it's still a good product.
It's a bit heavy and smells faintly of burning something, but overall it's fine. It's not so bad that i want to return it. I just wish it were lighter, I guess!
Love this dryer.love that its red, not happy with the concentrater it did not fit on the end. Had to use an old one I had. But the andis dryer I had before is on its fourth year. I am a hair dresser so I use it a lot! The only reason I brought it home was because the vent on the front broke. So I can't use it on clients any more. I am sure I will enjoy this one if not I am sure u will hear about it
The dryer has a very powerful motor, I'll give it that. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the hot setting was more like a warm. Most significantly, though, it left my hair oily-er than usual! It basically left it limp. I'm confused as to the reason for this, but I'm sending it back, regardless.<br />(Despite hating the condition it left my hair in, it did dry it relatively fast.)
This dryer works well, but the outer soft touch clear layer started to peel off after only about 4 weeks after purchasing it.  It's a shame since it looked so nice when it arrived and now it looks beat up and as if I've owned if for five years.  I've had other similar models by Conair in the past, but none ever did this.
to large than was pictured.After I ordered this one I found a smaller one ,the 124 AR Vagabond and it meets what I needed
love the wall mount. Turns out it wasn't all that easy to mount, especially if you are patience impaired. Four months later it over heats and shuts off. I do have long (almost hip length) and thick. It generally takes 30-45 min to dry my hair. I can't blame the hair dryer for over heating. It usually takes 3-4 minutes to cool down and finish the job. I don't like that it only has 1 heat setting. A &#34;cool&#34; air setting would be GREAT! Especially when it is already hot and humid. The night light is VERY bright, not a bad thing, but it could be turned down just a tad. I think I'll do more research before I buy another one. But I definitely do love the wall mount.
Not as strong as I hoped, not as compact as I thought it would be but it's better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in it's better days until it went bad.
This is worth the money you pay for it. I have ethnic hair and I use pretty big hair rollers. Fitting them in is a little bit difficult and It takes me a really long time to get dry because of this reason. Besides that, I have had no problems with mine so far. However I tried my mother's new Bonnet hair dryer (different brand), which cost her 40 Dollars and it's totally worth the 10-20 extra dollars. I get dried so much faster too!
nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment.  You can put items in, but unit will not close
I fell in love with this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel, and took a picture and found this exact model at Amazon.  It works like a charm for the past 4 months. Very good heat, low noise ( my 5 years daughter hates hair dryer with loud noise but she likes this one).  But it suddenly broke last week.  I had to run to a shop to get a hair dryer.<br /><br />But would I buy it again, may be.  since it is so cheap, the price of one of my lunch.  I may bought two, in case one breaks.  This is just me.
this blowdryer does work and blows great but the only problem i have is its to small i will buy a new one and give this one to my 11yr old daughter
I bought an Andis wall mount dryer 25 years ago and used it every day without problems so I decided to get this model as a replacement when the old one finally gave out.  I'm hoping that it will give me the same great service.  The unit is larger than my original more compact version, but it does work well.  the reason that i'm giving this product a 3 is because it's more cumbersome, the slide switch on the handle is difficult to operate, (it doesn't slide easily) and there is a very bright night light built into it which I was aware of, but was surprised by the level of brightness it emits. It's too bright since my bathroom is part of the master suite without a door on it. I had to put duct tape over the light to try to block it out. This dimmed it about 50%. Obviously I'd much rather not have the light, or at least have an option to turn it off.
It works, I didn't expect anything wonderful since the price was low. You get what you pay for, I guess!
After continual use, the cord eventuall stops retracting all the way and that is a disappointment.  Dryer itself works great but we purchased this because of the retracting cord.
I choose the dryer after reading about it in a fashion magazine. I was disappointed as it was not as hot and powerful as I had expected and the large size makes it rather unwieldly. I would have preferred something more compact. It definitley did not live up to its hype.
Pros: Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.<br /><br />Cons: They don't last very long.  I've had 2 of these: First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  Second one only lasted 22 months with same use frequency.  I've had other blow dryers last 10+ years, so its annoying that this product does not last.  The fan blades inside the dryer are made of very thin plastic, and they eventually just disintegrate.<br /><br />Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.
It's a pretty good sized hair dryer. Takes a lot of space to put away if you don't have a large sink cabinet.<br />Overall, it doesn't seem to require too much time to have your hair completely dry, however I really dislike the feel and design of the buttons (the ones to choose the temperature and the level of drying). They feel really flimsy and like they're about to fall off.
It's very similar to those hair dryer you find in hotel rooms! it does what it's supposed to, but it takes a little longer and it only has 2 speeds (which is on the description)! It's a good buy for the price. But it doesn't fold, which would be harder to put in a suitcase. Overall I'm satisfied.
I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and age.<br />This one was powerful enough but since I have thick shoulder length<br />hair, it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.<br />I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  I sent<br />it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could<br />operate again.  Handy size, but too many minuses.
This product came up in a search for travel hair dryers.  It is NOT a travel hair dryer.  On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers. And it's a ittle too loud.  On the good side: Does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair, and I really like the results. The price is fair.
I would like it more if it reached a higher temperature. takes a long time to dry hair. I have thick hair so I need a hair dryer that gets hotter.
This hairdryer is quiet and light and dries my hair very quickly.  It has cut my drying time in half.  I love the long cord, too.    Update as of 2/26/15: This has been a great blow dryer for just over two years.  This morning it died though.  I was using it and it seemed like the cord was coming unplugged as the power seemed to be waning and then ramping up.  I checked the cord and it was securely in the socket.  This lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died.  I threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall.  WTF?  That was crazy.  I never expected to have sparks fly at my face this morning.  So, it was a great dryer until it almost blew up in my hand.  I still give it three stars as it was great for two years.
switch is all wiggly, power is relatively weak, and somewhat loud, but it has been working so far and it is inexpensive
I ordered two of these dryers. I had used them before and I trust their quality. But, when the product arrived, I found that there was no  plug on the end of the cord. These units are made to be hard-wired into the electrical system. I didn't see that clearly spelled out in the descriptive text when I was looking for the product. As such, instead of going thru the hassle of returning both of the dryers I went to Ace Hardware and purchased some plugs to put on the cords. Now I'm just hoping and praying the connections don't heat up and set the house on fire.<br /><br />But the dryers themselves work great!
This hairdryer is pretty but doesn't get hot enough to dry my medium length hair.  Keeping it but wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.
I was not too happy with this hair dryer. It's a nice hair dryer but doesn't blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair. I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is. I would say it's a fairly good deal for the price. I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.I'm mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.
Like the size and shape.  The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn't work.  Didn't last long, otherwise very nice
it works fine, i am buying a new one. I thought this would be fine for work but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....
Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping.
I was surprised to find that the  item was not as quiet as claimed.  That was the feature I was looking for.
I ordered this one to replace the broken one,<br />I installed this product mainly to save the space,<br />but it is not durable, the spring latch and circuit<br />in the old one broken, it should last longer.<br />But overall, this product saves space.
Great hair dryer. It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.
ok but heavey<br />nice does its job but looks small was supprized how heavey it was.<br />has all the heat adjustmentas I was looking for
Shipment is on time just like how it is described.<br />Dryer is little heavy for use, I like compact once.
You know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets. Hangs down too much and hits the counter tops.  Good power though
This is a decent little hairdryer for the cost. But from the picture, I thought it would be pink. It's not pink, it's red.
After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time.
There are many reviews for this dryer, and in a nut shell, it works very well and does the job. I have two small complaints, but one of them is a big deal for me. I have medium textured straight hair that is very, very long. I like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat, is almost room temperature. It's not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50% longer than my old dryer to get the job done.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-nice feel in the hand<br />-nice frizz/flyaway control<br />-Low and high air flow<br />-3 temp. settings<br />-comes with diffuser<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Medium heat is too cool causing long drying time<br />-the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush, or wrapping of the chord<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy the same one again, but really, it's just a hair dryer!
Not as powerful as I had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back.  Otherwise, works okay.  Retractable cord is nice.
When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke!  Doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head!
Not the best dryer I've ever had. It works, but it seems to take a long time to dry my hair, which is wavy, thick and coarse. I end up straightening my hair, anyway, so now I just wash it and sleep on it wet and straighten in the morning. I don't bother with the blow dryer.
the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing.  No registration information and no product information was included.  Maybe shouln't have ordered it around Xmas time.
I gave it as a Christmas present. It looks pretty nice, but she didn't like it and asked me to exchange it for something else. She liked the look of it, confirmed It is less noisy than normal hair dryers, but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair.
Not as powerful as expected, but the fact that you can fold it really helps. Not the greatest but okay
It is an inexpensive dryer and it does its job with all the functions described. Nothing too fancy. I expect it to last for at least a couple of years.<br /><br />Update: I just deducted one star because it is too loud, louder than the average.
Initially I really liked this hair dryer.  It worked well and ran quietly, but it suddenly stopped working.  While it worked fine yesterday, when I plugged it in this morning it just wouldn't turn on.  Because I've owned it less than two months, I've requested a replacement through Amazon to give it another a try.
I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  My husband always complains about me blow drying my hair in the mornings before he gets up. In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn't seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don't know that I can really tell the difference. My husband hasn't been complaining about the noise as much, but I don't know if its because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it's actually a lower frequency. To me, with it up close to my head, I can't tell a difference.
I was disappointed with this product. It states it dries your hair 70% faster, but I don't find this to be true. Also the switches are in a very awkward place and I often turn them off by accident while using the dryer.
This hair dryer worked great while it lasted.  Only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel.  Otherwise, you are much better off getting something else
I'm a little disappointed, Andis.<br /><br />I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again.
The product is good. Working Properly, the variable speed switch is defective. It's not going on HIGH. Please Help !!!
I have long hair which gets frizzy if I don't use a diffuser with the drying. When I use the diffuser with this dryer, it is not very powerful, works great without it.
The price is great but the cord is too short. It came with all the attachments but it would have been so nice if the cord was a little bit longer, especially if the outlet is almost to the floor.
IT'S GOOD BUT VERY VERY HEAVY AND HARD TO HOLD.  DOES A GOOD JOB BUT IS DIFFICULT TO HANG ON TO
I had a Conair YellowBird Pro which is an awesome dryer. I had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack. Thought I would upgrade, and this BlackBird seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />It's not a bad dryer. I'm thankful it is 2000 Watts. But, it doesn't seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I'm still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.<br /><br />Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It's nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless. Next time, I'll make sure that I get the Conair that has the Cool-shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high.<br /><br />Not a bad dryer- does the job, and certainly better that the 1875 Watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore. Consider a different model if airspeed is important to you.
Chose this dryer because of the good reviews. Has a few annoying features: double buttons (heat and speed) and hard not move both when one only needs to move one. Also not that strong and so doesn't dry very quickly. Finally, sometimes the concentrator falls off. However, it was not expenssive so you get what you pay for.
The item was packaged well but we were missing the diffuser for some reason not sure what happened but package was received very quickly.
Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer.
This hair dryer is decent.  It is quieter than my previous hair dryer, but I wish it was a little quieter, especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it's key features.  I love whatever material it is made of.  Whatever it is made from isn't a slick plastic, so it doesn't slip around in your hands or on the counter, which is nice.  I would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes, so if you need a light hair dryer, this is not for you, but it's not so heavy that I feel like I am getting a workout.  I also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers. So, it's not a bad hair dryer, but it's also not all that special.  I would recommend it to others if it is on an AWESOME sale, otherwise, try something else.
I would not recommend this hair dryer since it only worked for three months. It was purchased in August and now, in November, it will not turn on.<br />However, if you are not as unfortunate as I am, this simple hair dryer is very surprisingly quiet and gets the job done very nicely.
Nice basic hairdryer. A little slow on the drying though. A little on the large size. Does get the job done.
After my old hair dryer died, I decided to get this one because my mom has it. I had it for only two or three months before it started to make rattling noises when I used it. I would hit it, and the rattling would lessen. However, after a short while of this happening, I was drying my hair and it started to smell smoky. I decided to give up on it before it caught fire or something.<br />If my mom didn't have the same one that has been working perfectly fine for over a year, I would have rated this one star.
I bought this based on other reviews indicating that it would dry my hair faster. They say 40% faster and I suppose that's accurate - 40% faster is really not as big of a difference as you would expect. It's also incredibly heavy considering there's not much difference between this and your usual hairdryer. If you want a good workout every morning though, then definitely get it!
I came on Amazon trusting the reviews that people would give this product. I bought it because it had high reviews and a great price. With a solid 4 star review, I expected a lot more from this dryer.<br /><br />The issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow. When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force! I mean, it's a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow. But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot. This was not the case.<br /><br />Mostly, I really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product.<br /><br />Disappointed and I would NOT suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you're really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price.
Product is light as advertised but does not seem as strong as it should be.  The first I received came apart as it was missing 2 screws, but Amazon was great and stood behind product and sent another out immediately.  That one is fine.  Love the T3 feather weight.
Careful, gentlemen.  The picture online and on the box shows it has silver trim, but it's actually bright pink trim (switches, filter cover, ect.).  Has a narrow mouth with a penetrating stream that's probably better for long thick hair than short hair.  Heavier than expected too.
In spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what I need it to do. I'm an African American Natural & I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments. I only gave this a 3 because it's not mobile & it's so huge to store.. Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it'd take a great deal of time but I don't use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments. But it adjusts just fine & I'm comfortable under it. You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose. I sit on the toilet w/it perched on my portable drawers I use for storage. I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I'm pleased for my intended purposes.
I purchased this for a trip I was taking to Mexico.  It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Unfortunately after looking at it and feeling it's weight I decided to return it.  As you know the airlines have strict weight limits on luggage. Given I was traveling for two weeks out of the country I need the room in my luggage for other items.  In order to reduce the weight something had to be left behind and I chose to forgo the dryer.
The dryer works really well, but as other reviewers have indicated, the finish on the handle starts bubbling and peeling after about a month of use. It's annoying, but it does work. Too late to send it back and I'm not sending it to Conair with $5 to get it repaired.
I used to have a turbo power hair dryer which is very powerful but the 3000 is little bit dissappointing because the dryer is not strong enough and bigger than I thought.
I had ordered this product before and accidently ordered a smaller version of the one I wanted.  It mounted easily and works fine even tho I would prefer a stronger drying force.
my wife has long hair and said this didn't dry it as well as her current hair dryer. However she will keep this for travelling.<br /><br />3/5 stars. Great design will retractable cord and folding handle. poor performance.
I needed a quick replacement for my spare dryer and wasn't interested in spending much money.  This one has two settings, a nice grip, and a little loop for hanging it.  It does not have a no heat setting like the one it replaced, and is pretty noisy.  Ours has also, after just a couple of months of daily use, developed a bit of a rattle when used at certain angles, which to me indicates that it might have something loose or just out of tolerance and that the dryer may not hold up long term.  While this met my needs, I'll likely be replacing it with a more expensive, slightly fancier model.
My only complaint is that there is not a hot/cool option, so it can get pretty hot, especially on the high setting.  Other than that, it's an inexpensive, quality hair dryer.
When this hairdryer came i was super excited. I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  It works well, nothing special.  It's nice that the cord can be stored inside the dryer istelf, but leaves the plug portion just hanging out awkwardly so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer. It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  it's okay, probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again.
This hairdryer is the loudest one I have ever owned!<br />I'm actually thinking of buying another and using this only<br />for travel.<br /><br />Other than that, it's very lightweight, compact and dries<br />well.<br /><br />Because it's so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.
I really didn't expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price.
I bought this hair dryer because i need one with a retractable cord. Otherwise, it is fairly heavy and kind of loud. Not the best or the worst, I have owned it for a while and it hasn't broken which is a plus.
i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair....i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago...they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....which is what this one does...i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this...so ill keep it...it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....
I saw the other reviews and thought this was the dryer for me. Well not so much. Yes it did make my hair less frizzy. But my main disappointment is that it doesn't have enough power nor did it dry my hair quicker.
This hair dryer gave my hair great body but when it came to straightening it it fails. Its really only because I have insanely thick hair, this product would probably work on someone with thinner and more tamable hair than myself.
I wouldn't have minded paying this amount for the dryer but it's really not good for travel after all.  It's much too large and heavy for tucking into a carry-on bag.  The name Featherweight is a bit misleading: it was more like the whole chicken plus the feathers...  Have sent it back to Amazon.
I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right. But it's powerful and I like that it folds in half. So now I just wrap the cord around it. But I wish it still retracted. :(
I have wavy/curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls... This hairdryer was actually too powerful (even on the lowest setting) for my delicate curls.  If I was going to blow it straight I'm sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls, I needed the diffuser to diffuse more (It felt like the diffuser wasn't holding back any of the air) and the air not to be so powerful (on low).  I ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight Revlon.  I wouldn't recommend this dryer to someone with fragile/lightweight curls but I would recommend for everyone else.
I thought it would be stronger. I even leave turbo option on all of the time, but my older, cheaper hairdryer definitely dried quicker. I do like the attachments though (diffuser, concentrator). It is heavier like I have read before buying, and the cord must be shorter because it gets pulled out of the wall by accicent at least once with every use. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.
What is not immediately discernible from the supplied photos is that the intake bezel and control buttons are all molded in bright pink pearl-colored plastic. That, and the fact that the box is printed in a all-over floral pattern tells me that this item is targeted toward the women's market. I ended up returning it.
I got this hoping it would be a good replacement for my last blow dryer that i loved, and had for 3 years. I like the bendable handle and retractable cord. the setting are nice BUT it randomly shuts off while im using it!!! Ill have it on medium heat on high and its like it over heats or something. Its horrible for when im in a hurry getting ready for work because it takes at least 10 minutes to cool down enough for it to turn back on. And its not the outlet, or the fuse, i can take it to every outlet in my house and it still wont work until it cools down. But for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected any better.
While looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me, I found this one. The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I'd just thrown away. I'd give it a higher review but I found the on/off switch to be in an awkard position. It is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money.
decent hairdryer. It gets really hot. Doesn't have separate buttons for air level and heat level. Instead it has one heat setting. Only one button that toggles between off high and low. the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily. I use this on my daughters hair. We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.
My old Conair ceramic hair dryer just died after about 4 yrs. Thought I would try this Ionic dryer. I've used it for about 3 wks now & have noticed no improvements to my hair. My hair is always shiny, so who can say? But as for frizzies or static hair, I have some issues & they were not improved by using this dryer. As others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using. You have to hold it by the sides only. Also the high speed is not much different from the low & neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer & many others I have had. But for what I pd it is a decent dryer. Nothing special, but it gets the job (of drying) done.
I travel fairly frequently, so hotels are a routine affair. I saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently. Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back. I just received my replacement device, it took 15 days in total to receive it.<br /><br />I really hope this one lasts a bit longer.<br /><br />EDIT: I added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up.
None available.
I purchased this product because quite a few of the Youtube vloggers I follow use/recommended it. I liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot, but I found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like I do, it heats up ALOT! I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair. There's not much that's special about this dryer, but overall, it's a powerful, not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer.
The hair dryer does exactly what it's intended to do. However, the product description is inaccurate. The so-called cool shot button does not exist on this product. One thing which I noticed though is that the product image was updated with the blue cool shot button removed in the new image.
The John Frieda JF1 does all it says it will. Shiny hair with no static. Dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers. The overall look is very nice. Just one major problem...its very heavy. If you are in it for the long haul,as with long thick hair styling,you better be young and strong. I am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and I find it easier to just use the curling Iron on most days. If you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying.
Nice hairdryer but it is very heavy to hold up for too long.  If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.
Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use. Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless. The warranty was for one year, so no luck there, and replacement parts cannot be found. Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don't know. I'm buying another, and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time.
My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily. I have natural textured African American hair. When I blow dry my hair I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector. I think the dryer is great for the price but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do. When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....ugh!
It's definitely not as good as the last Conair 1875-Watt dryer I had for 4-5 years. The dryer doesn't feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer.
This hairdryer is overpriced for the value.  I dropped it and pieces went flying.  I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place.  Not worth the money, wish I would have got a less expensive hair dryer.  All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag.  Not impressed.  Would not recommend this product to a friend.
I really wanted to love this hair dryer, and I do except for one thing: the placement of the control buttons is terrible! I constantly turn off the dryer and switch the heat settings with my hand while I'm drying my hair. It is pretty annoying.  Besides that, the dryer is great. It helps to smooth my hair and dries it quickly. It also looks really nice. Overall, it is okay, but I don't think I would have purchased it had I known about the problem with the control buttons.
I purchased this dryer a year ago and it has performed very well. I did go onto Amazon and  order the Babybliss tonight because this dryer has started sparking. When I am drying my hair I hear and see sparks. Crazy so I threw it away and researched reviews on several sites and ordered the Babybliss. I do not want to wait until this dryer burns my hair.
[[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]<br /><br />I bought this hairdryer from Amazon in July 2011 for $27.19 including the tax. It is now April 2012 and the cord stopped retracting. I just called Conair Customer Service and in order for them to repair it (at no charge), I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping and they will repair it and return it to me.  I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping. Obviously, that was the option I chose.<br /><br />Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it. Anything similar in quality and features cost more money so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  This is very disappointing.
I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime I dry my hair it feels and sounds like I'm running my vacuum cleaner.<br />It does dry hair-but I'm not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better. At least this one dries decently. I am going to keep using it, but probably wouldn't recommend it to friends.
I had severely damaged hair due to coloring, highlighting and flatironing.  I saw that this blowdryer was supposed to dry hair faster and condition it as well with the trick ions .Very disappointed in this dryer for the money!! Not faster by any means, actually it blows slower and cooler and takes longer than my Sally's Beauty Supply brand which is far less money. Don't take the advertising bait, don't purchase this dryer ladies and gents.
Two settings: low hot or high hot. It's really featherweight. Quick drying time but the motor doesn't sound as good as my old Italian made dryer. I wish I had tested it out in person first before buying I would return it but I got it for a song and don't want to pay the shipping cost and 15% restocking fee. It'll do.
This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while.
When I first came across this product I thought this looked gfeat and I wanted buy it. Whwn I received it in the mail, I still thought it looked great but it could definifintely use some improving. The case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes and I havent even dropped my phone!!!
This is a 4 star product but I gave it a 3 star as it is a 'travel' hair dryer. It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button. Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels & B&B's have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse). It is not a critical item in travel. It should be much smaller in size with the same quality & cool shot. It's 2012 & this shouldn't be difficult technology.
Takes a few minutes to warm up and the full force setting creates tangles in my hair but I am working with it and getting used to it. The medium setting seems to work well with fine hair, the jury is still out on this product.
I have curly hair & I use the hair dryer to straighten. The nozzle is too wide & the result is frizzy hair. They need to make a narrower nozzle for straightening!
I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success. This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products. I have long hair and I use large rollers. I find that getting the bonnet over these rollers is a little more difficult. I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.
This dryer was disappointing. Although it folds for travel, the cord attachment increases its overall size, making it clumsy and hard to pack.  The power switch sticks, making it difficult to turn on/off.
I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it's relatively light weight.But I had trouble pulling the plug out, as it was very stiff. When I finally got it out all the way, the cord wouldn't retract when I pushed the button. Also there is a scratch in the paint about 1/4 of an inch wide. Other than that it seems to work just fine.I like the cool setting.
I have thick and wavy hair type which frizz easily and takes a long time to blow dry using conventional non ionic hair dryers. When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.
in your description it said it has a cool shot.  This was the one thing that i was looking for, and it does not have it.  Disapointing.
- First of all, it came in it's original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times. I was sceptical, but I plugged it in and tried it out. It was a little heavy, but worked nicely. Though I didn't like that you can't change 
I bought the Andis 1600 hair dryer as an alternative to the Conair 1600.  The Conair 1600 is now impossible to find anywhere, but I don't like the more up-to-date 1875 watt Conairs as they blow either too hot or too cool.  The Andis has four settings instead of two or three on Conair dryers, which provides good heat control.  It's very robust and not too heavy.<br />What I didn't know when I originally wrote this review was that the first one would only last 8 months.  However, a replacement dryer I received under warranty is still going a year and a half later, so maybe I was unlucky the first time around.
The hairdryer is only okay. I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don't like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I've had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn't super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn't dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can't hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can't. I'll definitely keep this hairdryer until it's time to get a new one, but it didn't impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn't a BAD hairdryer, but also it's nothing special.
However, I would have prefered a more diverse group of piks.  I bought my husband a waterpik for christmas (which he loved).  I wanted to get a set for myself, but this one only has 3 types (none really as cool as his) and dups of all three. - It's a good beginner set I guess... but I will be searching for some of the better ones that came with his. I can't complain about quality - look closely at the piks - if you want two of each of the basics - this is pefect for you.
I know this product has been discontinued so when I found it here I was really excited.  I used this alot and really like the way it works.  This bottle smelled a bit differently that my bottle I originally used from the store.  And didn't work quite as well.  But I still use it and it is better than some of the alternatives I have tried.
I've owned 3 of these hair dryers now. They would break after a year or so, but given the low price and quality while it worked, I had no problem replacing it. This newer version is not as impressive. The eco options are great for the environment, but it takes twice as long to dry my hair. The heat is no where near even the middle option on previous versions. Might be great for those who don't need a quick dry and like the lower temperatures, but it was not what I am looking for.
I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for. I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase so naturally I checked to see if it was available. It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away. When I got home from work today the Amazon box was waiting for me - Woo-Hoo! my new hair dryer! - I opened the box and instantly knew that what I was seeing was not what I had ordered. It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven't even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it. I have had several Conair hair dryers through the years and I'm sure this one will be just fine (I will update this review after I use it a few times). I've never had any problem when ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case what you see is not what you get.
The dryer light stopped working after 3 weeks. It did not matter much. Today, exactly 1 year and 3 days after my purchase the on/off switch stopped working and I had to use the breaker on the unit to turn it off. I called the manufacturer and confirmed that the warranty is 1 year, but since it is just couple of days over, they agreed to send me a replacement. It is a direct connect so I need to take the wiring out and replace it with a new one. Oh well!, at least I got a replacement.
SO I haven't used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad.
I am just not happy with the really loud noise. I bought this based on the product's the minimal negative reviews and customers' reviewing it quiet. Other than the really loud noise of the dryer even at its lowest mode and the odd noise it makes when being held facing up and at the cool and warm modes, the dryer is very solid and a quite heavy. I tried the attached concentrator, the wind would not concentrate when blowing extremely closed with my ceramic round brush.<br /><br />Extreme fast shipping and fast refund. Still a happy customer after the good service. :)
Since I am using this on almost a daily basis (to take to and from the gym) I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  I like that it has the cool shot option.  I ended up getting the Baby Bliss travel dryer because it is about 1/2 the weight and I really like it.  However, it doesn't have the cool temp option so I'm hanging onto this one for backup.
The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the retractable cord is completely misleading. It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice. With that said, the folding handle still makes it easy to store. Good buy for the price.
The hair dryer runs a little hotter than I wanted.  Otherwise it is a good dryer for those who want a less powerful hair dryer.
Guess I should condier myself lucky, at least mine is working ... so far anyway! A lot bigger than I had hoped it would be. High speed has lots of volume, but doesn't seem as forceful as my last hair dryer. Guess some things require a visit to a real store. Otherwise, it's okay. Just hope it stays working.
I'm actually going to return this hair dryer. It's unfortunate (and I'm giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and the cord keeps getting stuck (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating. Overall, I'm bummed that this one didn't work out...
The dryer works ok - nothing special but there was no registration card in the box so I called the manufacturer.  They said the warranty is void since Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  I would like to have known that. So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  In addition there was no receipt in the box.
This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall. I won't buy another one. I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years. thats crazy. yes I use it everyday but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old. This hair dryer lasted 2 years!! thats ridiculous.
I really like this hair dryer enough to buy a second one. The first one made a popping sound and quit so hopefully this one will do better.
This Conair dryer is decent. The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient. Also the air only comes from out of the back, and not the front or the sides, and no matter what the setting is you'll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour. But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don't have time to head to the hair salon.
I've bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good. It's not the best that I've ever had, but works well for the price.
Works just fine.  I wish I had ordered a cord-keeper blow dryer, but that's my fault.    In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver.  At least mine was.
I love how this hairdryer is so powerful without being heavy. But i seem to have a problem with the heating coil, it turns a bright red and starts smelling like its burning within 2 minutes of use.
When I first bought this, I was not a skeptic about it. As someone who largely believes in science, I am very well aware that pheromones DO exist. I've also always wondered what it would be like to wear these pheromones. After exhausting the internet, it seemed that all I could find were pheromones catering to heterosexual men. Then I found this, and again, believing that it would work, I bought it.    Unfortunately, after using it for a few days now, I do not notice any differences in the way people (gay/straight/male/female) interact with me. They have however taken notice to the scent, and they love the scent, but I see no noticeable sexual excitement in other gay men, or increased mood and friendliness of straight men.    Soooo, it is now my belief, that the synthesized pheromone technology does not work in this cologne. However, its not a total disappointment, as I've said, everyone does love the smell, so I will continue to wear it as a regular cologne. But I was hoping for the pheromone technology to kick in, which never did...
If you ask me this product doesn't work much different than the Redken Full Frame 07 Protective Volumizing Mousse.  The mousse works better than the lotion it never makes your hair flat not even in the back.  I even tried a reviewer's tips and it didn't make a difference. I have fine hair.  I'll continue to use it because it makes my hair soft.
It works but i always end up having a sore throat the next morning..<br /><br />maybe because i swallow some but hey  it works and cheap
This is a really fabulous red sparkle polish.  It's a good product and I treated myself.  :-)  It's a bit hard to take off, but most sparkle-polishes are.  As much as I like the product, I do feel it is a bit over-priced, especially when you add shipping.    If I was to come across this brand again, in store, I would buy it, if it was a color I had to have.
It works. just like the one it replaced.  First-time charging is quite slow, so be prepared.  Also the rubber coating on the last one of these I bought discolored quickly, and the one before that the coating became sticky after a while.  I am hoping this third one is better.
This blow dryer has two settings... hurricane or puff of breath. Not much in between. It's great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you're used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge. It is fairly light, which is why I bought it. Overall, it is OK.
I have thin, fine hair and need to heat & rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.
I have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory!  My daughter has the original one and it's still going.  I however, purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn't putting out the amount of air it did in the past.  So I replaced it with another one and it's only been months and it doesn't get as hot as it used to.  Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform.
I had high expectations for this hair dryer and I am deceived. I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     This Fhi hair dryer is a bit heavy, and it didn't make my hair shiny and soft AT ALL. It didn't even dry my hair faster than Babyliss, but I have to say I didn't try it on at the highest setting, cause it looked to me wayyyyy too hot for my hair to handle without major damage.     I guess I'll get used to it, but I wouldn't recommend someone else to buy it, not worth the price.
Bought this for my mom to try it out because her $150 dryer went out after 9years and she said it dryes almost as quickly as her old one but is super loud! And does not leave hair feeling or looking as smooth and shiny as her old one. You get what you  pay for.
I wanted something basic, relatively inexpensive, reasonably well made, and sturdy that would dry and style my hair quickly.  That is almost exactly what I got.  My only real issues with the dryer is the flimsy switch and lint trap cover.  The switch doesn't click into a new setting crisply. You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position.  The lint trap cover just pops off and takes some careful fussing around to replace securely.  Sometimes even if you think you have it back on correctly it will pop back off a few seconds later.
I ordered the Andis based on the two speeds, cord holder, and   night light.   After installing, I wanted the higher 1600 W and you need a screwdriver to change the speeds. This is very inconvenient. After finishing the change and using, the cord stretched out and didn't return to it's compact size,leading me to think that's why they may have put the little knob on the side.  The night light is a nice feature.   I am disappointed with the look of the stretched out cord.  I will, leave the dryer on the high speed as it makes no sense  to keep changing the intensity.  Yes, it's quiet. Priced reasonably.
this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is... the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.If it had some ridges that might have helped. And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair.
Good size, nice to be out of the way and on the wall. Unfortunately, it stopped working 9 months after I bought it. I was sent a replacement and hopefully, this one will work longer!
The comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair. The design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer. Thought that is the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!
I've had this shaver for over two months now. Being in my early 60's, I've been shaving a long time. Having had many shavers in my life I'd rate this one as a good shaver. I've had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more. For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price.
I bought this kit for the screwdriver, and while it is small, it does work.  The kit comes packaged in a sturdy plastic box.  Overall, it works.
I think this product is ok, but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer.  Peter Thomas Roth should start lowering his prices for his products.  I can buy more products cheaper than his from Kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least, allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up.....
I have very naturally healthy and shiny, very straight dark hair, like that of the Native Amercans. My hair holds a curl very well. I already owned 2 different kinds of ceramic wavers and was looking for a more natural and less kinky kind of wave. This waver is ok, but not really what I expected. In my opinion it is not much different than the other wavers that are not described as DEEP wavers. I do hold Hot Tools brand in high regard from owning their products for numerous years. I would definitely take this deep waver over the other regular wavers, but wish I wouldn't have invested more money into the same kind of thing, more or less. I also do not like the dial adjustment used to set the temp on this because it is loose and changes on its own. I taped mine down so that it wouldn't accidentally set to a higher temp and burn my hair. Hope this is helpful.
Very nice hairdryer. It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while. Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly. Concentrator is included, so it helps prevent frizz. My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers. There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.
I know this was voted Best Hairdryer!!! by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks). This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.<br /><br />I find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you're going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out.
I have no problems with the hair dryer itself, however, one can't register the warranty because the company's drop down menu does not list the year 2011. I sent Conair two emails regarding the 'Year' problem and neither was answered. When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn't have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone. Also told me that they are having problems with the company which handles their emails and none get answered. Perhaps I expected too much from Conair. Next time I will seek out another brand. Also feel that if one can not register a product for the warranty, then Amazon should think twice before dealing with that company.
This product has some nice features. I have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home.  I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  I may buy another one just because I like this dryer but I definitely know what to expect now.
It is a nice unit. Compact and easy to use but it takes a long time to dry my hair.
I have a bad neck and muscle spasm in my left trapizius so it's difficult to lift my left arm. The blo and glo holds my hair dryer so I can use my right arm to style my hair. I only wish that it could be left up permantently on my mirror with my blow dryer in it, but it can't. It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own - it happened the first time I used it. I didn't know I couldnt leave it up (even though the directions say to take it down after each use - I didn't read that far - my bad). So, other than the hassle of taking it down each time I am happy with this product.
not sure if it's because of the attachment, but even on the highest setting this dryer just isn't that powerful.  I have a really short pixie cut and it's taking me almost twice as long to dry as my old cheap-y dryer...humm.
Bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years. Purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power. I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and   Attachments I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor. Ouch and it burns your hair. Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined.
We received this product on time and in good condition.  However, after about one month the connector on the bonnet came loose from the bonnet.  Poor job of attaching this during manufacturing.  Now must replace the bonnet and connector and having an awful time finding out where they may be purchased/replaced under warranty.  Does ANYBODY out there have any idea on where to go?[[ASIN:B000BBGS40 Hot Tools Professional 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]
I'm a dad so hair dryers are completely foreign to me.  Bought this for my daughter and when her mom saw it I got scolded as it's small enough that hair may be able to be sucked in causing some very bad times.    I would say it works.  She would say it doesn't work well enough.  3/5 stars as there are a few glaring issues if it's not only for a last resort.
The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue cool button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.
I've been using these powerful little dryers about 15 years because they fit nicely on the side of my vanity under an extended countertop. The only problem is that they only last about 1 1/2 to 2 years with 2 people using them daily - but the price is right.
I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage.  It also worked very well to dry hair.  However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up.
The heat and power is good, but in keeps shutting off in certain outlets of the house.
I have had three of these hair dryers, and they last me about two years.  I like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall.
I like the hairdryer, but am disappointed in the purchase. It was labeled as new, but when I got it I noticed that the filter already had quite a bit of lint buildup and there were little, cut hairs stuck to the velcro cord wrap. I got the feeling that maybe this item had been used in a salon. It looked pretty new, so perhaps it was used as a demo. The new description was therefore misleading.
Having baby fine hair and not a lot of it, I find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month.  There are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, the 1st heat setting being cool. The 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair. The highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head. The switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle. I don't think this dryer is worth its higher price.
Great compact design. I love the cord hanger. The light is pretty bright, but exactly as advertised. It does take longer to dry my hair-but it is doing less damage....
This hairdryer is ok.  I like some aspects of it such as being able to adjust the heat and air level, but I don't think that this dries my hair any faster than the other cheaper hair dryer that I have.  I also feel the weight on my arms that other reviewers were discussing.  I am not sure that it has had any effect on the level of shine or frizz in my hair although being able to adjust the level of heat and air has probably helped in terms of being able to prevent heat damage.  I think it is an ok hair dryer but I would not buy it again. I did not return it mostly because of the hassle of repackaging and sending it back.
This model replaces an earlier one that put out a lot of heat, but the replacement  one, while seemingly appearing to have been upgraded, does not put out the level of heat as the one I replaced after several years of use. That one died. Also, the digital clock is not included in the replacement model. That was a feature much appreciated so without it I feel a bit more of disapointment. However, the replacement model does look smart mounted on the bathroom wall.
The filter that I received was not an OEM filter as advertised. It fits very loose.
Goes on thick and doesn't blend in to skin. I also got some sun burn.
Have only used once but have high expectations.  Smell was not really so great but not horrible.  The after-tan smell (that burnt hair smell) was NOT BAD at all.  So well worth it there.  I could still smell it but it wasnt overpowering like most lotions are.  Gave me good color right out of the bed but not the best.<br /><br />I still think Worship Me does a MUCH better job giving you color right out of the bed...I looked like a goddess of the islands after using that just ONCE!  Also Worship Me smells better.  But meh, I'll try this and see.<br /><br />Hope it works!!!
My 30 year old Norelco died and they don't make the repair parts. My old Norelco worked fine with the original heads until the motor quit.<br /><br />The current model is cheap in price and feels poorly made. They recommend replacing the heads annually, but I'll use it until it fails and then toss it.
I received this product and enjoyed using this!  I was expecting a quicker result.  It wasn't a miracle worker for me.  Beth
This is okay but I'm not fond of the smell.  There is another bhringraj hair oil on Amazon that smells way better and leaves your hair soooo soft.
With this product I definitely see an improvement in my hair. It's shinier and not frizzy with the horrible humidity!!
I just got the mirror today, opened the box and to my surprise was a tiny little mirror. No where on Amazon did it say the mirror was actually only 6in x 5in, especially given the price. However the mirror does what it says and is fogless which is nice. The first time I used it I put water in the back and put it on the suction cups and within a minute it fell onto my toe. So i tried cleaning the area behind the suction cups with some soap and that helped and it didn't fall the second time. Given the price I would expect the mirror to be larger, but on the positive it is actually fogless.
I purchased this product hoping for something that would eliminate my hair problem or at least help keep it under control. This product does exactly what it says it will do and works well. Very durable, you don't have to worry about breaking because it is indeed a spring. But WOW, does it ever hurt. I just can not put myself through that pain on a daily basis and if you don't do it just correctly it increases the pain by 1000 times. This method of hair removal is much worse than waxing. If I had thicker, tougher skin that wasn't so sensitive I would love this product but it is just too much pain for me to handle!
I feel bad not giving this a great review.  I love how safe it is and it seems to work well.  It's also not that expensive as far as mineral sunscreens go.  I just hate the scent though.  I put it on my son, but use a different brand for myself.  I'm probably a bit more sensitive to scents than most, but I'm happier with California Baby, other than the price.  I haven't tried the unscented Badger though, and probably should.
I had to work too hard to have this absorb and I don't think ou should have to do that with an eye cream. another cream for my hands until its done
Despite the hype on this product, do not expect less frizz-- it is not one of those specifically ionic ones.  My sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one, said that she had better results with other blow-dryers.  Ionic blow-dryers give my thick hair a smoother, healthier result, but this blow-dryer does no wonders.      Blow-drying time is also not very short (I have long, semi-thick hair and it takes FOREVER to blow-dry...  air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time.   Can you blame me for not liking to use this blow-dryer?).  I like the cool setting, but other than that, nothing cool.  I can't believe I invested into this blow-dryer!      On the other hand, it seems to be reliable and may last a while.... but all of my cheaper blow-dryers did last a while also (in fact, I still have them but I wanted an upgrade).    I like the separate vent cleaner.  No more clogged vents!  That feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one.  I feel that this was a poor investment.      I have no idea how the other reviewers got great results, but my great results came with great products.
I bought this hari dryer about 2.5 years ago. I liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light. It was never the most powerful hairdryer but I generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls, so I wasn't that worried about it. If I was pulling and straightening my hair every day, this would not have been enough power. That said, it worked fine for what I needed. However, today it started to spark. This is not hard wired, its just a plug in model. I was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out. I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this. Too bad.     Considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product, I would not buy it again.
Unlike other stretchers, this one will only widen your shoes, not make them longer.  This isn't made clear in the description.  It's still well-made and I was creative enough to make it work, but if you're looking to stretch a shoe length-wise this probably isn't your best option!
gave them to my granddaughters for Easter  they use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college
This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  That in itself is so frustrating that I can't see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.
I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting. Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should. Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn't stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.
It does the job. I could use a bit longer razor, as it is a pretty small head. It's also a lot sharper than I thought it would be.
I ordered the product about two weeks ago. Shipping was fast, the product came in a plain box and was well packaged.  I have several skin tags on my neck and applied product carefully with a q-tip as directed. It has a stinging sensation on application so I was careful not to apply too much solution to the tags. I got some of the solution on the surrounding skin but applied the ointment to stop the burn. The solution burns the skin very quickly so you have to be carefuly not to apply too much. The burns has caused my skin to become discolored, my neck now looks worse than before and my tags haven't fallen off yet. That was a week ago, so I will now use a small brush to apply and hopefully this will prove a better applicator than the q-tip. I am now looking forward to be rid of the tags and acid burns on my neck.    If you are interested in purchasing this product, please proceed with caution. Maybe the suppliers could provide a small applicator with this purchase.
I've been using the Sonicare for many, many years, probably 15 years, when they first came out.  I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e-series that is supposed to fit the Advance handle.  I ordered the three pack of the e-series and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use.  Apparently, the magnets on the e-series' don't match what was originally designed for the Advance handles.  I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise.  It's not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads.  The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise.  Philips should tell the user about this difference.  It's no big deal, but should be disclosed.<br /><br />What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months.  The old packaging said every 6 months.  When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals.  Whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy, I do not know.  Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don't know.  But in any event, since I've been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I've changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I've had no complaints from my dentist.  I guess I'll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn't change the replacement head after three months.<br /><br />But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.  The e-series does fit, albeit not perfectly.<br /><br />Stay tuned.e replacement head after three months.    But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.  The e-series does fit, albeit not perfectly.    Stay tuned.
The dryer is heavier than expected, and for the wattage, it puts out less air than it should.
I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week. The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount. Another piece of crap.
I like this product. The chord is long enough. Noise level is not too loud. Two power levels. The only reason I only gave it three stars is because I don't know if it's going to last.
I loved this...while it lasted.  After 3 weeks, it stopped working.  I also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because Amazon is not a registered dealer. The seller has agreed to replace it when I mail the product back. Just be aware of these potential issues.
A fairly good hairdryer although not very powerful - but adequate for my purposes.  The first one I received didn't work at all and had to be returned.  This one works fine, but was a little difficult to install.  I love the night light - it is very bright, but one can always close the bathroom door if it's bothersome.  I would purchase this item again.
It does not heat as well as I think it should, barely adequate and would not purchase again.
I purchased this hair dryer to replace one my daughter borrowed from me.  I thought this was the same item,  but was sadly mistaken. My original blow dryer was also Conair Ion Shine 1875 watts, but it is a much better product, this one feels very plasticy and cheap, it does not have the power you would expect for 1875 watts either.<br /><br />All that being said for the cost of the dryer it works and I will keep it, but next time I will spend a few extra dollars for a higher quality hair dryer.
My hair is curly, so I think this dryer is not so stronger for my hair.
Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  It was out of warranty, and because I took the case apart to check for the problem, they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it.  Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit so well where I had it hung, I went ahead and bought another one.  It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.
I bought this to replace a similar Andis dryer that I bought 2 years ago that konked out.  This one looked similar, but was much louder.  The old one was billed as being quiet; this one was not. A quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me, so now I am off to find one...
The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments. I'd swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment.
item was shipped quickly. however i was rather disappointed at the quality of the item. it didn't leave my hair as soft as i would have liked it to be. it left my hair big and frizzy.
Hairdryer is heavier than I'm used to.  Controls are on handle and in the way.  Otherwise, it is just a hairdryer, no better or worse than others.  Could've spent less with same results.  Was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Will keep it until it stops working.
I bought this for my girlfriend after seeing it advertised on tv.  It sticks well to the mirror but there is a problem with the adjustable arm.  According to my girlfriend, her hair dryer is too heavy and pulls the arm down.  I told her to get a smaller hair dryer.  That didn't go over well.
I am getting the funny smell on high as others have described.  In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.    The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch.  The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed.
I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.     From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the going out sound bother us. You bet it does!     UPDATED: 12-30-2008  Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out.  Only lasted several months.
The item is described as a soft bonnet hair dryer.  The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet.  The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!
Install was easy and quick, loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord.  night light is really bright, I mean REALLY BRIGHT.   I think it's quiet ( as in the lable)is because of the lower speed  of the blower  motor. I prefer more air moving. Dryer does a good job all in all.
I am super picky about my hair dryers.  And while this is not the best one I've ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it's not bad.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones.  For me ionic dryers = flat hair.  So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent.  I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can't be too choosy at this point.
Had this for about two years and the bearings have already started to fail. Makes more noise than when new. It's ok... but not great.
I got this item on sale. I like that it is small and my diffuser fits on to the end (the nozzle on my old dryer was too wide), but the coolest setting is still quite warm, and it starts to smell like it's overheating after about 10 minutes of use. I have short hair, so I only use it for about 10 minutes, but overall, it gets the job done.
The Elchim 1800 R/B hairdryer performs great. I should know because I've had 4 of them.  I keep buying them on average 1/18mos.  This IS NOT good.  The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I'm thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims. The cord is NOT round as stated in some other reviews.  It is the flat type. Wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation.
It looks great on the wall, but just isn't very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.
This dryer is perfectly adequate.  I'm not as exhuberant as some other reviewers, but I can't really find anything wrong with it.  Size and weight are fine.  Noise level is fine.  I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and I don't have trouble with them.  I don't think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  The one strange thing is I couldn't find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I'd be disappointed.  I've never used the more expensive models though so I don't know if they are any different.
Pros:  ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    Cons:  the 'blow' component isn't all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that's probably partly why it's so light)  obnoxious color    This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power. I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the 'blow' action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn't a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I'd really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I've purchased this blow drier. I'm going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer. It's ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn't get it again.
I would have given this a better rating, because the dryer performs just fine. I especially like the variable speeds and heat settings.     CAUTION: Be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug.
I am 63 and really wanted to try this. I swirled and tapped and noticed that the places on my face that are Not lined turned out nice. But I wanted a little more coverage due to some spider veins and 2 age spots. So I put a second coat on and these lines under one eye really stood out! I didn't know I had them until I used this product! So I got some makeup remover and took off the bare minerals that was on top of the lines and they disappeared! On those, I put my regular liquid foundation (on the lines)and all was well.  <br />  I think you should have nearly perfect skin for this to work nicely.
If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this.  I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair.  With that said, the various heat settings work well.  The concenrator attachments work fine for me.  I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.<br /><br />Update:  When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it.  My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer.  I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer.
The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning.  I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.
Pros:   <br />1. This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. <br />2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a mid-size. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   <br />2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It's loud.  <br />3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. <br />
This was a fine dryer, but I returned it. It simply wasn't as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers. The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings. That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it's much quieter than other dryers I tried.
When my toddler is sick with a cold, I don't want him to go to bed after his bath with towel dried, damp hair but he was afraid of our regular hair dryer. He is definitely less afraid of this one which is a huge plus. I use it myself and find that it doesn't take me any longer to dry my hair than usual. I also like that it is lightweight. I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem.
I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars.  Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand.  His observations were the same as mine.  If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase.  But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers.
This is my only experience with an ionic hair dryer, so I have nothing with which to compare this one.  However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.
