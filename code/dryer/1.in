I've had this blow dryer for just over a year, and it finally started smoking and sparking so bad, I believe it would have caught on fire if I didn't turn it off.  For the last 6months, if not longer,  I've noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I've used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I'ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I'll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.  Please note that on their website over half of their blow dryers seem to be discontinued, hmm wonder why. I'll update my review once I hear, or don't hear back from this company.
not good
The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  Now have to have it replaced.  Just annoying to have to deal with this.
It broke the third time I used it piece of crap
It suddenly can't turn on days ago.
A non working product. Just west of time and energy. Well they refund my money but I don't recommend this product.
Over heated in 2 minute! We had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to Amazon. Good luck if you want to order this through online.
I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It is alway stay at my home in one place. I occasionally used it and never moved it. Now it can not stand anymore. The plastic base and 3 legs are broken. I called the customer service and they said the warranty only for 60 days.
Does not turn off.
This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.
junk... the diffuser does not fit on the dryer. My whole reason for purchasing this item!
Did not work in Italy
I want you to send me a new one.  After 1.5 years of using this, it blew up on me.  This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought.  Even my conair hair dryer from 15 years ago still works.  Please contact me to send me a new one.
I bought this hair drier for my girlfriend 3 months ago, expecting it to be great. The attachments do not attach to the drier! It is now useless to her and too late to exchange the product.
Junk! Highly NOT RECOMENDED! It was broke for a week used!
We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part so we could just use the same wall mounts.  Time to try another brand!!!
Was a great dryer. Loved it. However it burned out within 2 months.
I've only had this for about six months and it's goes off and on while I'm using it. Then today after the dryer had been off for over an hour it started humming as if it were &quot;stuck&quot; on. Can't return because it doesn't fall withing amazons return time!!! NOT NOT NOT HAPPY... DO NOT BUY!!!!!
Did not work, return policy do not allows you to return. this product was defective, sucks I can not return it. Save your bucks and do not buy it!
Please don't buy this. I used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when I turn it on. It should go to trash now.
Too Heavy.
I have had this hair dryer for just over a year - 379 days to be exact and this morning when I went to turn it on, no dice. Dead. I have had ConAir hair dryers that have cost $20 last longer than this one,so to say I'm unhappy is an understatement! I don't even use it everyday- maybe 3 times per week AND last summer, I left it while I traveled for over 2 months, so the life of this this thing was seriously short. BEWARE~
When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &#34;hi - lo&#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &#34;high&#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.
Terrible blowdryer. Scary to use as it sparks.
Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.
Problems using with uk adaptor
I've had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature. The last one I purchased through Amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use. Thats just poor....
Meh, it just doesn't work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person's head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn't tossed the box.
This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.
Ordered this and upon arrival the dryer stopped working. It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat. Not pleased with this purchase. I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud.
I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair. The return period for this product is one month and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer. Very displeased with this purchase.
Doesn't retract. Very cheaply made. I returned the prodcut.
Comb breaks easily, a little hard to old without touching all the buttons.
This is NOT a true diffuser. A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer. I returned it after a few tries.
Only used it for 2 weeks. The bottom piece would get too hot! I got burned a couple times and it also melted my extension cord because of the heat. Total disappointment!
BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before.
Took a chance but this does not fit the Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL. The search continues! (And now I'm stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)
THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER!!!!! I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well and the next time I tried to use it the cable exploded in FIRE, burned my hand and almost caused a fire!!!!!!
This unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase
I love this hair dryer.
Garbage. Had it for a year, the cheap plastic fan is cracked and it's done.
Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made
The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won't stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed.
I did not like the design or the size so I sent it back. Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.
I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.<br /><br />The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool...
retracting cord did not work after a few days!
Blew out coils after 2 weeks of use.
It is too loud.  I googled quiet hair dryers and it came up.
Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews. It periodically shut off until finally this week it stopped working completely. After only 4 months, a hair dryer should not stop working. Definitely would not recommend.
Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer.
doesn't even work i dont know why i've kept mine for so long... oh well
This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool.
This product was a terrible disappointment. The retractable cord stopped retracting almost the first time I used it.
Don't waste your money.  I mounted it and it's terrible - loud and doesn't dry hair very well at all..now I have to unmount again.
I bought this item and it shipped on June 9. I bought a place and finally got to putting it up July 12.  It didn't work; it didn't even turn on. I went online to Amazon to exchange it for one that worked, but they said my last date to return it was July 11. So I say don't bother buying this piece of crap; and be careful about buying things thru Amazon.
DO NOT BUY! As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.<br /><br />and<br /><br /> I would look for another brand.
This is the first 1 star review I have ever written. This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled.
BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get &#34;0 STARS&#34; for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime.
So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.
This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.
This blowdryer caused outages each time I used it so I had to stop and buy a new one!!
After limited use in 5 months, the unit only works on low.<br />Will need to get a replacement.
over heats quickly, do not recomment
I love it!
Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!
It wasn't as I expected.<br />I HAD TO RETURN IT.
Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low.
brush too soft. gave it away.
Amazing at first. It gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had to re-place it.
I purchased this product March 27. It is June 15. The comb attachment started losing teeth after the 3 use. The attachment now has a crack in it. Very upset. The whole reason I purchased this dryer was because of the comb attachment. I am going to try to contact the seller to see if they will replace it. It's too late to return. Also, it's actually melting.
I only got to use it 1.5 times when I was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out.... I would like a refund but don't know how to go about it. I used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out
I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.
The Elchim dryer is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is loud, controls are not easy to use, heavy and  no filters.  My current dryer is 10 years old and IS a professional model, much nicer.  I gave this one to our Abused Women's Center.  In asking beauty salons about it I did not find one hair stylist that was familiar with the name or had used it.  DON'T WASTE your money on this one, it is a piece of junk.
This is a replacement of the same blow dryer that I had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine. The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months. I have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and I think it too is going to stop completely.
Died within 3 months of use every other day.
Bought this about a year ago and recently it starting having green sparks inside of it and today it stopped blowing warm air. Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.
Bought this hairdryer about a year ago. When I was using it the other morning, it went on and off and went on fire. Needless to say, I am not recommending it.  Never had this happen with any hairdryer I've owned.  No stars doesn't seem to be an option, so it gets one by default.
Used item , hair in back of blower , I paid for new item , very disappointed
I have short curly hair that is both course & thick. Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer & diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact. Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn't distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying. I would've been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me. In the process of sending this back.
Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I'm not sure if it's this one that's defective of they just don't make them like before.
It was damaged in a couple of months, poor quality
I have always bought Conair products in the past, so I never expected this purchase to be problematic.  The dryer works fine, but none of the attachments fit tightly and they fall off with the slightest touch.  It's a huge design error and frustrating as can be.  I would never recommend this product.
Purchased to replace an older Conair 1875.  The GFCI plug on this unit failed after 45 days of normal use.<br /><br />In the future I will look for a dryer with a UL safety listing.<br /><br />Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk.
Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!
I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th. The heating element stopped working on June 3rd (so it worked for only 3 months.) It will blow air, but not hot air. Returns not allowed after 30 days.
This hair dryer died within 4 months of buying it. Waste of money.
The dryer blows cold air on US settings! Worthless unless you're traveling abroad!
I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating
Light too bright
This is the WORST hair dryer that I have ever had. The one that Andis quit making, and I guess replaced it with this thing, was SOOOOOOO much better than this punny thing. Anything can blow harder than this one, it's terrible. The nozzle (I guess that's what you call it) anyway where the air comes out is so big around, what little air that comes out goes everywhere and you can't style your hair with it. Seems as though when a company comes up with a good product and it sells good, they can't stand it, and then they come up with something in it's place that is terrible and they think people should except their stupidity for making such a mess of things. I have had Andis wall hair dryers for years and loved them but, this one is the poorest excuse for a hair dryer that I have ever had!!!!!! Thank You,<br />Louise Bell
I sent it back.  Basically not worth it.  Heavy - cord did not retract all the way -- not what I was looking for.
this product did not work at all, it seems to be newand fine but never went on
Hard to flex into position.
Doesn't fold!!!!!
Overheats REALLY easy :( It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that... I would also prefer the tip &#34;thinner&#34;
Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither.
Would give zero stars if allowed. The day it arrived, took it out of the box, plugged in and nothing. Just a big puff of smoke that smelled awful. Unplugged and it continued to smoke. Very disappointed in this. Thought I have found a trusted manufacturer and decently priced hair dryer. Back it went for return.
My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.
very disappointed- i have bought this exact product about 5-6 times over the last 8 years- it was awesome- great heat great weight attractive-etc. but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket- and sparks- which is scary- i love the hair dyer itself- but the new design of the plug in is faulty- what can be done?????
The description for this product is incorrect.  It does not contain a cool shot button.
burned up first time used
Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can't imagine what the &#34;professional&#34; is, certainly not a hair salon with this &#34;quality!&#34;  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste.
Stopped working after 3 months.
Not recommended.  It doesn't get hot and the comb was flimsy. Very disappointed
I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.
I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it.  The hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp, the &#34;power&#34; is too strong and makes my hair completely flat and yet, doesn't seem to dry it unless it's on these higher settings.  Also, it is a very heavy hair dryer.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Wish I had kept the box to return.  This is not worth the splurge.
Simply doesn't work!
The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off & there's nothing you can do about it. Don't waste your money
It's really bad!! It stopped working from the 1st use 
over priced junk
The motor died after a year of very light use. (2-3x/month). It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept 2013.<br /><br />I wasn't very impressed even while it was functioning. &#34;Blowout&#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair. (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)
Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!<br />Would NOT recommend
Dryer is extremely heavy!  Not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers.  Buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying.  Returned it after trying it once.
The picture of the product is deceptive. I bought it on Amazon and what I received was a very cheap looking product. The instructions on how to hang it on the wall is also very confusing. I am concerned about the safety of this product so I have stopped using it. Now I am left with a cheap dryer that I am never going to use. I wish I can return it back without paying a ton on shipping.
I bought this. Broke. Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is and it is off counter. I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke. Says I cannot return so now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 - will never buy another one. Terrible product
This i gave as gift & it blew up within one month!!!!
I want to  return this because it does not have a plug.
ANOTHER BLOW DRYER THAT CAUSES FLYAWAY HAIR AND THE FRIZZIES!  I WISH SOMEONE KNEW OF A MINI DRYER THAT ACTUALLY STRAIGHTENS BANGS!  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DRYER DOES NOT DO THE TRICK, I AM SORRY TO SAY!
Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer. I have used Conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before. This one was a bust :-(
I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.
Not as powerful as advertised.  Air force is weak.  For price you get what you get.
When this arrived i didn't even open it for a couple weeks, but as soon as i went to use it, it only blows cold air!
The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out. Dead in under two years. I bought it for $26.75 two years ago on Amazon Prime and now it seems tripple the price! How is that even possible?
Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.
The heat setting is only two it said it would have four not happy
When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn't feel right. It didn't feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I'm not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn't even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won't even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.
Did not like this at all. My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!! Returned immediately
This dryer was purchased last summer and safely stored while we moved. I pulled it out this January, and the low setting has already stopped working, while the high setting barely pushes out any air.  I'm now convinced this was a fake, and am sorely disappointed. Amazon is always our first stop for purchases such as these, and I've always been very happy with their customer service... I have a request for a refund in, and we'll see how this resolves.
I didn't receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer.
This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it's an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed
I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I'm very disappointment and is too late to return it.
Works okay, but very heavy!
This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  At the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock. As soon as I got mine delivered. The product page shows this product is no longer available. Anyway, I returned it and got the Babyliss one. Much happier with the other purchase.
Broke within 2 months.  I would recommend buying a few levels up as I have had those in the past and they do not break.
wasn't what I expected.  Thought it would have been more powerful.
Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house!<br />Item RETURNED and refund awaiting! Do not trust it!
This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.<br /><br />I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.<br /><br />Thus, had to trash it.<br /><br />I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)
This item died after maybe the 10th time i used it. Good thing it is inexpensive. Save your money and dont buy this, keep looking.
Heavy, bad temperature and flow control. It is not handy at all.<br />Bay Bliss hair dryer is much better and smaller.
I returned it.
I had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years.  I still have one but one the other one broke I reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months
The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.
DO NOT BUY! Lasted 1 Week!- Gets Hot and Quits in less then 3 minutes- needs to cool off then will work for another 3 minutes!<br />Aggravating and not worth  the time to order this product.
I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one.
Broke after 2 uses. But It couldnt be returned because I was in a different country
The voltage switch was broken...could not use it on my trip oversees.  Would not refund me because too much time had passed. Big rip off
I have had this blowdryer for about a year and it already died.  Ironically, it is the most expensive blow dryer I have ever bought and shortest life as well.  Disappointing...
This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.<br />Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years<br />It almost made it to it's second birthday. Pitiful<br />I purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement<br />It is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics
Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days. I only used once a day, & it got burned out. I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth.
horrible
This is a piece of junk.  Set it up on the high watt setting, but found that it would not operate after my wife dried her hair. Setting it on the lower watt setting solved the problem for a few months.  Now the same thing often happens and it makes lots of noise.  I think it will stop entirely very soon.  Tried cleaning the lint out several times.  The lint screen is buried under plastic strips making it difficult to clean.
Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today. It just quit. Reset button won't fix it. Very disappointed as I had a much cheaper hairdryer and it lasted years. This has only lasted 3 months!
Only used for few months and already quit working.
I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise. Excellent Excelllent 10 Stars
dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks
Not good at all
The hood collapses. The hood does not stay mounted
Quit heating after 60 days,
I don't know... Grat price but too weak.
Seems great at first, but it's not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen.
The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!!
Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.
DANGEROUS!!!<br />This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used.
Can't bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.
Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  This hairdryer keeps on shutting off !!! Soooo annoying!  Prob not even real BaByliss
I would have gone with 0 stars if I had that option. I gave this to my daughter for her semester in Spain. She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money. The bad part is I got an email saying the first one I ordered wasn't coming so I ordered a second. The first one came as well as the second. I didn't need a blow dryer to use in the states so now I have one that can't be used and I that I don't want
Stopped working in 5 weeks
I purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work. Would not recommend
I got them on time, so credits to Amazon Prime for being fantastic.<br />Unfortunately, the product was defective and didn't work at all. The material used is very cheap, flimsy plastic and the weight of it is disturbingly light. I do not recommend this product even for people who rarely use their hair dryers.
I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I'll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.<br /><br />The heat in this isn't as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn't hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion. The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don't have that happen on my regular blow dryer. I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat... This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out. I'm not sure if it is just this product or if it includes other diffusers like this as well... but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!
Not the drying power expected
I'm not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn't dry their hair. So I can't figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus. But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair.
Had it for only a few months and it already is losing it's heating element. Also the dial to change the heat doesn't work. The attachments are flimsy and get stuck easily. I can't wait for it to completely break so I can buy one that works properly. I wish I read all of the reviews for this product. Never again will I make that mistake.
It never worked. Not dual voltage as it is said to be. Will never buy any electric item from Amazon again. Epic waste of my money
died after about 6 months of use
Quit after a few months.  I bought this blow dryer because the one I was using was 10 years old & could reasonably be expected to die soon.  The old one is still working.  This one is dead.
I had expected a cordless dryer.....that is what I had asked for. I returned the product
I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn'tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn't work on it either!
Plastic junk.  The speed and heat setting buttons are flimsy and hard to operate. Also the smell of the motor is awful.  On most dryers the smell abates after a few uses.  This one smells as if it's burning.
I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.
Good
It did not work
very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.
DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER.  I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster.
Broke after a month and a half :(
Terrible blow dryer!!! It caught fire rite after I turned it on!!! You get what you pay for with this dryer, LITERALLY!!!!!
Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the &#34;low&#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The &#34;high&#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the &#34;hot&#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the &#34;warm&#34; setting.  It's now completely worthless.
I really loved this blow dryer however,  I have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working. I didn't use it everyday either.
Broke after using it for two weeks
The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).<br /><br />Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk.
Product description is wrong. There is no &#34;cool shot button&#34;.
Sadly the product broke the first month of use.  I would not recommend purchasing.
Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don't waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!
does not turn on - very dissapointed
I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke. Now I cannot find a replacement comb. If anyone knows where I can get one, I would appreciate it
It dosent have hot air!
I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn't get much worse.  I'm not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.<br />This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn't have tried it twice.<br />Do not recommend.
The exterior of this hair dryer melted and I can no longer use any of the attachments. Poor quality for the price.
I don't remember why I sent this back, but I think it was because it did not fold up closely enough. ML
Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair.
The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened...
Bought this for a monthly back-packing trip to South America. It broke after a week.  It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.
Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn't very expensive.
Worked for a while. Then, it broke. I bought it a month ago. DO NOT BUY IT!
This is now the third unit in the last 4 months. #1 bought as a replacement for a 2 year old unit burned up in just a few days. #2 to replace #1 lasted about 2 weeks we are now working on #3 lets see how long it will last. Although I like the convenience of a wall mounted unit if this one burns up I will opt for money back and try another brand.
I had the hair dryer stored away to use when the remodeling was done in my bathroom i would say at least 8 months. I did not even use it 6 times and it just died. I was heart broken. Had i known i would not have stored it away, I would have used it right away. :(
I got the wrong one
The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.<br /><br />The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.<br /><br />Buy another model.
This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can't get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister's T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$.
The brush on this is like a baby's brush it did not brush through my hair. Terrible don't waste your time buying. Price is great but brush isn't
Cord has unmovable stop on it. Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.
It only worked for 6 weeks.
I used this dryer only a couple of times. Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit. Yikes! I What a waste of money.
Has no power like my old one.. Would not purchase again.
Way to loud, and it takes a long time for your hair to dry.
Burning smell had to return it after use
The bonnet is very tight on my head. There seems to be no way to adjust. Very disappointed. I will be returning.
Unusable .... Bought for Mom to use to dry hair in rollers. The bonnet and closure is so tight and small there is no way to get it on or use it, even with small rollers and a small head!
Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one<br />UPDATE<br />Don't bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn't much money, but they shouldn't build them to fail in such a short time!
It's hard for me to believe this is an Ionic conditioning hair dryer. It made my hair dry & frizzy. Nowhere on the dryer itself does it say it's an ionic dryer which made me think the listing is incorrect.
Did not stay on.
Died within a couple months. I am so disappointed in the failing quality of Conair products. Do the controls really need to be under our fingers the whole time?
I bought this hairdryer last year on April 2 from &#34;iShopHappy&#34; and it's already broken...complete with sparks and a terrible burning smell.  Beware for fakes and Chinese junk...when purchasing hairdryers and in life in general. Caveat Emptor!!!
This product does not work well at all. My 19 dollar Conair works better than this.  I made contact with T3 on their website, they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system.
NOT VERY GOOD
Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned
I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model. I was sent a 130 volt model which when plugged-in went bang.<br />So cannot review obviously.<br />When I went back to check the voltage it wasn't readily obvious what it was. It took quite a bit of searching to find out I had bought something unusable in Australia.<br />My wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.
It's like holding a jackhammer !
Purchased 5/2014. Dead as of 12/2014. Perfectly competent (nothing &#34;ionically&#34; special) while working. We've gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers. You make the decision.
I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.<br />What a disappointment!!!
I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer.  The button on it didn't work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  It was a total waste of money.
I used this for six months.  I actually liked it during that period of time.  BUT after using it once a day during that time period, it burst into flames and practically exploded while I was using it.  Word to the wise - if your hair dryer starts to smell like garlic DON'T USE IT.  Incredibly dangerous.
This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don't think it would last very long if it did work at all.
Stopped working and almost burned my hair from sparking at the base of the cord. AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS!
I wish I would have read the reviews on this dryer before buying it. I've only used it 4 times. The dryer stopped working after having it on my head for about 5 minutes. I can't believe it actually stopping working in the middle of me drying my hair. This is so unfortunate. Buyer beware!!!!
there is Spark fire come from inside I think this is defective one
returned it
I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids' house for when I visit.
The motor blew out after a year and a half
I've bought this hair dryer for international travel.  It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless.... I guess it overheats but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it.
If I could give this product a negative I would.  Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first, it great power and heat.  It lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out. I contacted the seller, but I was beyond what they would cover.  Then I contacted the distributor who said &#34;no problem, send back the defective product and we will replace it.&#34;  Neat, sent it back at my cost :(.  Receive the replacement pretty quickly, yay!  Sadly about 6 months later I had the same issue with the new one cutting out, no power.  Not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so I can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month. DONE.
It was much larger than I expected as it was to be used for travel.
I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn't think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted.
Useless
Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.
i need to exchange it for another hair dryer
Yes, I was tricked into leaving a good review so that I would qualify for a replacement if the hair dryer broke within 2 years.  Now that I've had a while to use it, I found out it's JUNK, COUNTERFEIT, BOGUS, FAKE, GARBAGE, etc.  It is definitely not a genuine T3 hair dryer!  I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.  Convenience will mean nothing if the products are worthless.  If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you've ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store.
No power.  Combs and brushes were not right for my hair.  The ends of the combs were sharp and hurt my scalp.<br /><br />Unusable, should have returned it, but I threw away the box.
I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.
This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-(
First one shot out sparks and died after about two years of usage, not a bad run but a frightening end.. I loved the size so had purchased a second &#34;back up&#34; soon after buying the original. Put the backup in service about six months ago and the blower on that one started sounding odd recently, Today it made a loud noise and a piece fell off inside. I'm about to shop for another brand..
ordered purple, got red/pink. plus my hair get caught in the intake
Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase. Would not recommend.
Hoy recib el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcion. Es muy lamentable para m encontrarme con esta situacin. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. Gracias<br />Today I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you
Must have got a dud but ours died!
Dryer does not work good at all! The high setting is more like using the low setting No power! I have another Revlon Travel version I bought at Walmart for 12 dollars and works so much better than this. Very disappointed and waste of money. DO NOT BUY!
this blow dryer is good at first but it's quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn't seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.
The on off switch is broken. The only way to turn it on is by pressing white button on plug and turn it off by unplugging.  Not what I normally expect from an Amazon or Revlon product.
Boughtt in July 2013....now the hot setting goes from hot to cold all while in the HOT setting.....
Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren't stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I'll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn't very expensive.
Don't waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed & so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &#34;it just doesn't get hard or blow hardly any air.&#34;  We're keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it's useless.  Again, save your money & skip this product
Purchased in February 2014 and quit working in November 2014.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  It only worked for nine months; come on....
It did not fir my hair dryer.
worked for 5 seconds then stopped working.  due to moving, this disappeared so I couldn't return, but i must have gotten a dud.  I'm going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying.
Not al all what I expected. Low air output.
Not what I expected. The dryer is poorly made.  The nozzle flies off about 3-4 times while I'm drying my hair.  It's very annoying!  I will most likely return.
very bad hair dryer, it stopped working soon.
Do not buy this.  Bought mine in Sept o1, 2014. Went to  dry my hair last night, Nov 8 , 2014, would not turn on. Only used this dryer maybe 6 times, only blow dry my hair if  washed late at night. To late to return to Amazon.  Six uses that is it.  It does have a reset and test  buttons which I  pressed several times. Still the dryer would not turn on. Not happy that I spent $40.00 for a hair dryer that I used only six times.
nunca recibi el producto. me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor
Unfortunately I banned it wrong power connection for australia
Has no power.  Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it.<br />Makes a horrible whine sound when I use it and takes a long time to dry my hair.
Awful sound and no power.  Returned it.
This product is crap. I should have read the reviews! It is so loud you need earplugs to dry your hair. The cord won't retract with out an extended battle. DO NOT BUY!
The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! 
only one speed HOT Burnt my ends Had to get rid of it
Just got it.<br />It broke right after the first use.<br />I tried putting it in different sockets, still didn't work. &#62;.&#62; Horrible defective product.
First time I set it up the base where the wheels are cracked! !!
Don't believe the &#34;High-velocity airflow&#34; statement - this hair dryer only had a low & medium setting.  I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.
Hair dryer blew up the third time I used it!
Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I brought this dryer. Because of the price it caught my attention. but it doesn't dry the back of the hair. Terrible designing!!  That all I have to say.
I have had this dryer for almost 2 years.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Today, a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire.  It was like a torch.  This is so hazardous!
I just received this in the Mail yesterday and there is a short in the wire and it sparks...WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
I purchased this blow dryer November 5, 2013. Today is October 14, 2014. The heating element died. I have not dropped or abused this dryer. I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer but I am disappointed. I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don't find a difference.
Died as soon as it was plugged in, despite having it on the correct power setting.
Came in a beat up box, clearly used even though listed as new. Different watt then listed. Then exploded while I was using it within the first month, luckily I didn't get hurt. Worst hair dryer I have ever bought. Absolute waste of money.
It was damaged when received. Now I have to pay to return it.
You know this WILL actually dry your hair pretty quickly. CONSIDERING IT RIPS IT OUT WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE BACK OF IT! Who designed this thing-Marques De Sade- seriously I wasn't even trying to dry my hair - I was using for shrinkwrapping the windows , when BAM! the damn thing sucks in my hair in a whirlwind of pain. That's when it is actually working , I know that its normal for it to go between hi and low power, but after less than 20 seconds its like&#34; can I take a break now?, Drying and ripping hair out is HARD!&#34; - it sucks- literally - maybe buy it for someone you secretly hate and would like to see bald.
It's hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts. It doesn't get hot at all you can hold it directly towards your scalp and it's only warm. Definitely not worth the money.
Terrible....lasted only 6 months. Only used this like 1-3 times a week.
Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again.
Unfortunately, my dryer is broken. When switched to 250, I can not move the heat level passed low. Also, the bristles to the brush arrived bent. I have thick Sicilian hair and the brush does not comb through my curls. I will be returning this product.
I had to send two back.  They both were broke.  One ran for about 30 seconds.  :(!!!!
Used it three times and it died!
This dryer is definitely lightweight like people have said.  It feels really cheap.  The one I ordered wouldn't get hot enough (certainly not as hot as most hair dryers with this wattage), and the heat would go off and back on while using it. Took forever to dry my hair.  I'm sending it back.
I waste my money on it! I have thin hair and this one doesn't work with me, not hot at all! 
Lasted 9 months ... purchased December 14, 2013 .. Died September 25 2014.  What happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years?  This one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working.  Probably the 4th hair dryer I've bought my wife in 5 years ... I guess they are just a disposable item now.
This dumb dryer was underused and it overheated. When I bought it only good reviews were to be found. Now I see plenty of dissatisfied customer reviews. Well I can add mine to all of theirs. Don't but this dryer. A cheap dryer I've had since a teenager still works and this one broke after 10 months of use at maybe 2 mins of use per day. My husband used it and he doesn't have long hair.... Very disappointed in this product. Seller would not take it back.
This does not mount CLOSE to wall. There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall. You can mount it with the provided bracket, or with a screw through the back. Either way there is a gap that requires caulking. Not a small gap.
This blow dryer stopped heating up after 2 months.  It only blows cool air now.
Save your money, this dryer is cheap and rightfully so.  The blower is not very powerful and the new method of covering the small filter on the back of the fan is a small hinged door that keeps popping open.  I removed the small filter thinking it would then stay shut and it still pops open.  I have used Conair for years and always been happy, but this one is a piece of... ah Junk.
When the product arrived the back peice was open but I popped it back on. It works good to dry hair like in the salon. However after about 4 uses, yes four,4, it started smoking from the back and never came back on. There was no warranty info in the box. Ive contacted the seller so I guess ill see what happens. Its been basically a month of owning this crap and it doesnt work anymore. Total waste of my money. Im very upset.
I bought this hair dryer in May and ever since I got it, when I turn it on it runs for a while and then it just shuts off , I have to wait between 10 and 15 minutes for it to come back on.  I would really like an exchange and I have not figured out how to contct you.  This hair dryer is still under warranty.  Please advise me what I am supposed to do as this was a pretty expensive hair dryer and it has been cutting out since I got it.  I could not find a way to reach you.  Hoping someone will contact me soon.  Thank you
Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it's now September). Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping & handling fee. And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.
Even though I paid more for this dryer than others I've owned, it died suddenly after just 10 months even though I only used it 2-3 times/week. When it did work, the long cord got terribly tangled and was a pain, so be sure you want that if you buy this. But my advice is to buy a different brand. I've bought many brands of hair dryers over the years and never had one die after less than 2 years use! Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn't want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $.
Bad product started a fire throw yours away
It does not give enough power using the 220v
Do not buy this Hair Dryer.  I have it since May 2014 and it stops working after a few minutes and will not turn back on.  Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  Since I paid about $20.00 for the hair dryer it is not worth it to replace it when I can buy another brand.
I have never rated this product by given it a 5 star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!<br />Thank you,<br />Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent
I ordered this hair dryer to use for travel. The first time I used it, it caught on fire!  The manufacturer reluctantly exchanged it for a new hair dryer because it was after the return parameters. Really?  It caught on fire!  The replacement went on a trip to Europe with me and the VERY FIRST TIME I attempted to use it, it AGAIN CAUGHT ON FIRE! I'm lucky it didn't catch my hair on fire...and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel towel!  Very scary.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50+!!
I received the item in time, however, it is defective - the hot air does not work, only blows cold air. I have to return it and buy another one. Very disappointed! Do not buy from Maitri Mega Mall.
Broke after two months. Heat function no longer functions.
Please do not waste your money like I did. It lasted me exactly  3 minutes. First it heated up and turned off automatically within a minute or so. I restarted it, but it immediately turned off again and this time for good. I tried to return it for a refund, but the status kept reading : we are waiting for your return or something similar. It is not the end of the world, but I certainly am a very unhappy customer.
Dryer broke during first use between the base and the dryer itself.. It cracked it still worked and dried my hair well however it is made very cheaply with cheap plastic!!:-( :-( :-( :-(
I bought it in May and it blew up in August.  It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  Up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer.  Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective.
causes circulate every time!
December 2015 Review:<br />Well, despite what I wrote earlier, this blow dryer did not last as long as I'd hoped it would. Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself. You do have 30 days to return, although I will not be returning mine.
I know this is supposed to be the best hair dryer ever, but it's not. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine has never worked very well. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. And yes, I do clean the filter regularly. When friends stay over and borrow it, they always comment on how horrible it is. I look forward to traveling so I can use those crappy little hotel hair dryers attached to the wall, because they work better than this one. I don't normally write negative reviews, but I can't recommend strongly enough NOT to buy this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on a ConAir model, and you will be much much happier. Don't fall for the hype like I did!
This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine. 04/16/2015 I spoke too soon, this one is just like the one before it, fan exploded in a dozen pieces. About 3 months out of warranty. I've had it with this model and manufacturer.
Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for someone to get back to me. One more business day and I'm going to request a refund and return.
The unit started smoking today when in use.  The built in GFCI fried after just over a months use.
Handle would spark when turning on and off
This item broke in the second time I used. I am totally returning it.
None available.
It worked great for about 8 months both on 110 and 220v. Unfortunately it's started making a weird buzzing sound after about 8 months and smells like burning. Dang.
I have relatively thin hair and this took forever to dry it! I wound up returning it after one use!
Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside. I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there's no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else.
I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  The reviews were all terrific, so I just assumed I was not adjusting the ion settings correctly.  My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  I've been trying to contact the seller, but have been unsuccessful.  I'd love to know if there is some trick that I haven't discovered!
This dryer super heats, smells like it is burning and gets so hot on the handle you cannot hold it. It is a fire hazard and should not be sold.<br />Someone is going to get hurt. Since I cannot return it i will put it in the trash. It could burn your hair off or scar you for life.<br />DONT USE IT
Do not order this product!  My first one lasted 6 months-the fan quit working and it almost caught fire.. Returned it for an exchange.  They sent me an opened item with visible marks, etc.  Guess what?  The same issue again.. No fan, and it smelled like wires were burning.  I have no desire to return or deal with Andis.  This product is dangerous and as far as I am concerned, it is not merchantable.  Do yourself a favor, Stay away from this hair dryer.  It is absolutely no good.
I bought this hair dryer less than two months ago and it has stopped blowing hot air. I tried cleaning it, adjusting the settings, and pressing the &#34;test&#34; and &#34;reset&#34; buttons on the plug. Very disappointing!
These seem to work up until a couple of months after warrantee expires in one year. .am ordering my third so I don't have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.
When I received the dryer it was broken.  I was unable to change the speed of the dryer from high to low or use the burst of air.  The button was broken.  I returned the dryer.
I didn't even plug in the hairdryer and try it because it was WAY too heavy. There's no way I could hold this thing for more than 1 minute.
Says quiet on description however it was the loudest hair dryer ever!  They should remove quiet from the description!
DON'T BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!!!!!  Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.  Conair doesn't have to worry that anyone would be stupid enough to take them up on their warranty (and flushanother $20 down the toilet) and Amazon, must figure that most of the dryers will work long enough that it isn't their problem!
Does not work with longer hair. The blow dryer sucks the hair in thru the fan and can burn it and cause damage. That's what happened to me and my daughter who both have long hair.
Died after only a dozen or less uses.  Smoke and electrical smell from unit.
BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 & originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else.
The cord does not retract. I've bought this blue dryer for years in the store and the first one I buy online doesn't work the same. Pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason I buy it in the first place.
The concentration attachment falls off repeatedly, and I mean every time I use the dang thing. Another deal breaker is the length of the cord, it's way too short. This blow dryer is going to be replaced.
VERY Heavy. On/Off switch right on handle and gets turned off during use all the time.
It melted the first time I used it in Europe despite being on the right setting. Complete waste of money.
Motor went out after only a couple uses.
The blow dryer blew out the second I plugged it into the wall.
It's HUGE!  It was described as more of a travel dryer, but it's way too big to put in a suitcase, and too expensive for quality, cheap looking plastic.
Worked great when 1st used. small size makes it easy to hold and use.  Quit working after 1 months use.
Did not like it at all. It gets way too hot and the piece does not stay on. Save your money and buy a better one. There are no heat settings so you are stuck with the hot one that eventually will dry out your hair. I had to return it :(
If you're extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer, this is not for you.  Still had to wear earplugs during use; I wasn't expecting a whisper-quiet operation for the price, but this is NOT QUIET. It still woke up someone sleeping in the next room.<br /><br />Even using the dryer as far as I could reach from my head, while using a round ceramic brush, this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair. I now have tons of split ends that I did not have while using (what I thought was) an inferior dryer.  The $15 cheapo dryer I picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level.
Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel. Won't fit. There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague.
I bought this in April, by the beginning of June the heating element went. I was drying my hair...turned off dryer to bring my daughter to the bus...walked back in -  turned on the dryer and there was no heat. ridiculous.
Purchased this item but was disappointed when the higher setting of 1600W did not work.  There was no noticable change between the 1200W setting and the 1600W setting.  Returned the dryer and will try another brand.
I have used the dryer several times and it works great.  I had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision.  Definitely recommend.
I'm a big fan of con air and ION dryers in general. However, I'm disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.<br /><br />1) The styling attachment falls off 5-6 times during any blow dry. The latch or ability to attach is minimal. While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying<br /><br />2) The coord is very short. Unless you have an outlet right by your mirror and from waist-level or higher, you will need an extension coord to use this dryer.
arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  It's a shamed that product didn't last...Shamed on you<br />I don'tt have the ticket anymore.
I bought this and it broke the second time I used it!  I do not use my blow dryer often, so when I finally used it again the second time, it made a very loud noise and then would not power on again
Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  I contacted the company and they told me to send it back with a note saying &#34;defective&#34; and my address so they could send a replacement.  I paid $12 shipping to send it to them.  It's been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don't know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
Bespoke Labs sent me an 1800 watt model.  My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.
It says that it's dual voltage, but it took about a minute to burn out after being plugged into a 220 outlet in 220 mode. Also, the mechanism to switch between voltages requires a screw driver, so make sure to do that BEFORE your trip. Because most of us don't bring screwdrivers when traveling.
Brush too soft. The hair dryer too bulky. I would like to return it. I do not know how. Please, respond.
Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful
Works just like the big boys. Same power, light weight. I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag.
Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  I can not believe this has happened again.  I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  Save your time, money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand.<br /><br />Edit:  I received my replacement hair dryer today and I hope the cool shot button doesn't give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer! Thank you!<br /><br />This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It's more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.
This hairdryer shuts off after a few minutes because it gets so hot.  It was  disappointing because I was in Hawaii for a wedding and I couldn't use it. I had to find another one.  Never again.  Waste of money.
This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly. It takes a really long time to dry hair, and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat. I waited too long to return it, so am stuck with it.Going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing. Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough. Mine may be defective.
I would have given this product five stars at this time yesterday. Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working. Totally unacceptable.
I think I got a dud it doesn't blow hot heat, my old hair dryer blows more heat to dry hair faster
Cheep in price means bad performence. A little better than air dry. Not hot enough and no air force. I should have not been such a cheep skate and bought the more exspensive one.
While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.  In my opinion, this is shoddy workmanship and not worth the money spent.  So, I would recommend finding another hair dryer to purchase rather than this model.
This product had been used and packaged up. The dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low. I will be returning the item. I liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly
I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died. I have been very disappointed with the one I received and would have sent it back if I had not thrown out all the packaging. The attachment it comes with- which directs the air and was one of the main reasons I liked it- will not stay on. :(
We have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year (coincidentally, a few months past the return window).  We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won't be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn't as hazardous.
This hair dryer is impossible to turn on. The switch is flat and very hard to move. Additionally this small thing is very noisy. It is really a shame because the hairdryer looks very cute. I bought a Conair instead, also 1600W but it is really quiet and with an easy to push switch. It does not look as elegant as Andis, but it works so much better and I think it is also a little lighter.
I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase.
I regret this purchased , 30 days and my dryer stop working.... Bad quality product , not worthy ... GET SOMTHING ELSE . I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE RATED SO HIGH
I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers.
At first it was great, but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now, not even a year old has stopped working completely :(
I agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was.  I didn't even take it out of the package; ended up returning it on my own dime.
I did not enjoy this product.  It was almost too powerful...yes there is such a thing.  The previous bed head Bh407 model was great, why mess with a good thing.  Returned.
Ordered it for my wife, but the bonnet was too small so she had to return it. The alternate brand worked fine.
the first days love it.... I didn't use it every day, just 1 day every other week... after 2 months, it started to smell burned and didn't turn on.... it is trash!!!
After about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound.  When I disassembled it, I could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound.  Had I not seen this, the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user.  There has been no recall so all the products are suspect.  Do not buy this product.
&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. Don't get cheep like me, this hair dryer  is loud! Even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the Infinity Cord-Keeper , it's the bigger that's better. The larger version acts like a muffler. Spend the extra $20 bucks. I did, the real deal is now on order.
I joked that at $10, this hair dryer will be lucky to last one year. It lasted a month. By the time I checked to return it, I had missed the deadline to do so - by one day. Yup. This baby died quickly. Sometimes, you indeed get what you pay for.
The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces. Used one time what a was of my money
Purchase this item use it once and it's already in the box to be return. My daughter have natural hair so its all it easier to come her hair when it's blow dry and this could bit do the job at all.
First, it's red and not blue. Second, it's large, very heavy and loud. Third, after 3 months' use, it died on me. Vendor offers no return/replacement after 30 days.
I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone's hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else's hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I'll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!
The bristles on the brush are too flimsy to straighten very curly hair. plus this drier does not get hot enough or have enough air flow..it took forever to dry my hair and i was left with a frizzy mess.
Few problems with this Dryer.<br />First: I've had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.<br />Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I've received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.<br />Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer's warrantee is void. This creates a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this from a different seller.
My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!
I ordered this during the holidays, with the knowledge that my current dryer weas gonna go anyday, well it did, and I just opened this and used for two days, it makes a terrible, terrible, humming sound......and I can not return due to that I waited to long to open it and try it now my return date is past.
While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn't return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn't even gotten around to hanging it yet.
I was really expecting a great little hair dryer, but it was not.<br />It is super loud and overly hot and makes a bit of a grinding noise.<br />Just really did not like it at all, so I sent it back.<br />Still looking for a quiet, powerful, but not too hot dryer.
The ground fault circuit interrupter (the little red button) never worked and so the dryer never worked either. It was designed so that the GFCI couldn't be opened or repaired.<br />This was a total waste of money. Of course we never used it until the day AFTER the return date expired.
I really liked this dryer so much that I bought a second one.  The problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up.  if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund.  Seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue.
2 out of the 3 attachments don't fit the dryer; very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  You won't be happy with this if you're looking for a professional grade dryer.
Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally so I deduced that it is dual voltage). Amazon shipped this item to Singapore (220volts). Once I tried it on, it fried my adaptor plug, and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds. Such a dissapointment!
this dryer arrived in an &#34;icky&#34; plastic bag inside the 'banged up' product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn't want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed.
it costs too much electricity!!!!<br />i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!<br />it is quite too mass
The cool air button doesn't work at all.<br />Other buttons are all right but I am not satisfied with the product.
This thing is junk.  Got it for my wife after her other wall mounted hair dryer died.  She hates it.  Not enough power.
This worked great, while it worked. I only had it four months before it stopped working. The two speeds became one which was slower than the low setting. Of course, I was past the date to return or exchange, so I am back to buying a new one. Not worth it, unless you  only need a hairdryer for 4 months.
I purchased this dryer in August 2013. February 14th the heater element burnt out. Very short life but great when it worked. Wondering how to return or replace?
I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  But after struggling with it I now realize it is a bust.  The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  You must hold onto the tube or it falls out.  And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  I hope no one else gets conned into buying this.  If it hadn't been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.
I was very happy with it for the first 5 months, but was shocked this morning when it made a loud bang and tripped the circuit breaker.  I have never had a hair dryer break in this short amount of time.  Buyer beware.  I can't return it, but I'll write Remington and let them know what I think of their product.
The dryer was, dare I say it, GREASY. I thought as long as it works, fine. Nope, does not work. The seller, hottest deals, should be ashamed of what they sent for the price I paid.
I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways?This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions? but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice? if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.
Bought this hair dryer in May, 2013.  After about 9 mos. of use, I noticed that the fan speed suddenly dropped to its slowest speed eventhough the setting was for the highest.  Then, I saw tiny little sparks inside the hair dryer at which point I immediately turned it off!  I've never liked the hair dryer, in part because it's positioned in such an awkward upward angle, causing me to twist my wrist to force the angle down.
i have only had this for alittle over a month and it broke today. will never buy another one from here.
This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise.
but i don't. the biggest thing is that it just doesn't dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don't like about it, such as the hose doesn't fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn't fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn't allow for much mobility, but it's way more effective at actually drying.
Low speed is not very low.  It blows away my hair.  Had to go back to old hair dryer.  Very disappointed.
Said it had three speeds but it really only had two.  Temperature was either too hot or not hot enough.
As I tolld you before.  This item came broken and had to trash it.  Haven't the foggiest if it was any good or not.
Don't buy, product stopped working after using it only 2 times...waste of time and money...very disapointed...had good reviews but certainly didn't live up to them..
I never received it. But went out to get another and hated it. It does not have a warm just hot so I burnt my hair and my childrens to the point my hair is damaged in front. I do not like this product at all. Besides the color I would never let anyone use this product.
I like the hair dryer itself, while it was working.  Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  Now I have to figure out how to return it, because it says I am past my return period on Amazon and can't return it here.  Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!
I used one of these for 6 years & it worked well. So when the first one died, I bought another. But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one. Will try a different brand this time!
Because the blower dryer is not 3000wAtts is only 1800watts. And for the type of hair I work is not strong.
This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues. The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment. After that it just stopped blowing unless the &#34;cool&#34; button was pressed. Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady. Very unreliable.
I turned it on and it only blew cold air, even when adjusting the settings. I didn't save my receipt or box. Be warned!!
Three Conair dryers.  First one went on fire during use.  Second one didn't make it a year before the button broke off to retract the cord.  E-mailed Conair and they responded with lengthy instructions on how I can fix it.  Instead, I threw it away and bought the 260PX.  Although it worked well, it stopped working after 13 months.  I contacted Conair and was given instructions on how to get a new one under the limited warranty.  With the cost of shipping both ways, it would cost me the same to buy a new dryer.  So that's what I'm doing...just not from Conair.  Will never buy another Conair product!!
I really don't understand the good reviews. This dryer feels so cheap and flimsy. Almost break the switch on first use. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Don't buy it.
We just received the package and opened it. My husband tried out the retractable cord and it doesn't retract. Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well.
I have purchased two of these units.  First one lasted a year before burning out.  Thought it was the way my wife was using it that was the problem so I purchase another one and it now it is an expensive night light.  It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.
I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.
Product gets way too hot.  The attachment that comes with it does not fit snuggly.  Have used it 3 times since buying it and I am not pleased.  Seriously considering returning it.
After one month of use when I turned it on it made a terrible noise and plastic parts starting flying across the room. Vety dangerous. Piece of junk. Price should have been my first clue.
I bought two of these in March of 2011.  Within 12 months the first one died.  This morning, after 32 months of use, the second one caught fire in my wife's hand.  These are not a quality product and are even dangerous.
To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.
The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!
It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!
This thing died within a month of purchase. Bought it for the girlfriend to use when she visited. So it wasn't even everyday use for that month.
On and off switch broke after one week of using it.High heat was not that hot.When using it smelled as if something was burning.Would not recommend to buy.
lasted for a few months and then crapped out would not be worth buying again only used it 4-5 times a month.
I took the hair dryer to Asia and while there, I put it on the 220 volt setting and plugged it in.  It worked good on the low fan speed, but, when I put it on high, the hair dryer smoked and immediately burnt up.  I had tested it in the USA on the 110 setting and it seemed to work fine.  This unit in my mind will not work in Asia without burning up.  It was either defective or not engineered to work on 220 volts.  My friend really needs a hair dryer in the morning and was not a happy camper when it burnt up.  I
Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.
Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn't have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry. Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.
My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!
Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.
you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it's worth it it
Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great.
This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!
Terrible product.  Cheaply made, loud and doesn't have much power.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Save your money and buy the Onel MK-II..
Giving it one star because I haven't even been able to use it...it blew both fuses on my universal adapter.
It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it's not like I'm trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It's been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It's like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn't have happened so soon in my opinion.
Hard to use. I have a $20 hair drier that works better. Don't get why it is so expensive. It  does not have a cool button
This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.
After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.
Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can't even open it to see what the problem is....
I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!
The dryer works great. The only problem is the hose won't stay on, it falls off when using it on my clients.
Don't buy!!! Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!! Very scary. I will be returning this product. And I repeat...Do not buy!!!
I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!
The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.
I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.
Bought 2 of these hair dryers. The first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing. Thinking it was because I dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another. This one lasted 3 months same thing. I will never buy conair again!
Does not last.  I bought two and they both burned out in a few months time.  It was Waste of money!
The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don't even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!
I hadn't owned this 10 days when it created an electrical issue......the fire department had to come ...I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits and he assured me it was not my electric outlet....he believes it is the dryer.....I would like to return but now am being told by amazon that my window to return has expired.....not impressed with amazon's service....I should add that this is my third one by jerdon....and I have never had any problems previously.....obviously a lemon....would like it replaced for free....with a new one....not a re-serviced one....some one should agree to do that....
I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won't contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can't even dry my hair now.  It's like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00.
I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  I would re-done the review sooner but didn't think of it.  Don't waste your money!!!!
don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years
I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire
The Hair Dryer died on us after using it for a month. All style but no substance with this product. The slide switch almost came off and will not work. No air for my hair! The only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light.<br />Not recommended unless you want to throw money away.
ABSOLOUTLEY USELESS. WAS SENT DRYER FOR USE WITH AMERICAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY!!! TO USE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY MASSIVE TRANSFORMER.SCRAPPED IT AND PUT IT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE
Great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months, the second died after about 5 blow drys! So listen to the other reviews, I didn't and now I have to buy another dryer. Update: Tried a third, it died after 3 or so blow drys. Clearly defective model, it can't handle it's own heat.
I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I've had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don't waste your money.
It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality.
Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it's supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I'll just have to order from folica.com.
My old one had less watts and was much better than the new one. The old dried my hair in half the time it takes now.
This hair dryer was listed with a &#34;cool shot&#34; which I specifically wanted.  When it arrived I noticed it did not have that feature.  I decided to keep it anyway and plugged it in.  It ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Never to run again.  I have another Andis product and it works fine.  I could have paid to ship this item back which seems wrong to me since it was not as advertised.
After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!
Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.<br /><br />it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage.
This has hardly any power.. there is another product Pro Beauty Tools Pbdr5886 Professional Travel Hair Dryer, White and Black  which is far cheaper at $25 and 1800 watts, ionic and dual voltage. I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That's it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says.
I was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use. Lucikly we have not any injuries!!!
I bought this item for my elderly mother.<br />She and others have tried to use it but<br />the hose keeps coming detached from the<br />bonnet.<br />I would not purchase this product again<br />or recommend it.
this product does not work well ensendido the button came broken and I can not turn off<br /><br />este producto no trabaja bien el boton de ensendido vino roto y no lo puedo apagar
I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.
I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I'm not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.
I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.
This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn't dry hair as well as the old conair I had.<br />Next!
I purchased this hairdryer back in November of 2012. Fastforward to June of 2013 and someone was using the hairdryer while looking in the mirror and it BURST INTO FLAMES!  Luckily the person threw it down and put out the fire but last time I checked hairdryers don't normally do this.
Sent all eight of them back, they were to bulky and big, looked smaller on line, not what I expected at all.
I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.
This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.
The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat. The cord gets stuck all the time and is too short even all the way out. The unit is heavy to use. Gave it away after two uses.
The first two did not work and were replaced by Amazon. The 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up - after turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Luckily, we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire!
Not a good buy... Nothing like the ion brand!! Doesn't get hot enough to dry thick hair!!! Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!
I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.
When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again.
The thing that you put in front isn't their!!! and every time i try to use it it blow half of my hair the other half is flying up!!! hate it!!!
I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.
I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!
The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.
Don't let the cheap price draw you in. This hair dryer is not worth it. I tossed my still working hair dryer that I had owned for 8 years when I bought this. 6 months later it caught on fire. Yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell. Frightening! Do not buy!
I bought this for my wife, my comments on the result of purchasing this product a year ago:<br /><br />This is not a good for drying, I don't know why the professional word is on the description, next time tell this is for home use, home result, totally different to result my wife get from beauty med level professional.<br /><br />I'm Disappointed with this purchasing, but the time to send this back and get money back.
my hair looks so dry after i use it. i am very disappointed. i would of returned it but i lost the return slip!
Returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best. I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.
I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.
I've had T3 products before...my last T3 hair dryer lasted 3 years and change. I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.<br />Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!
I received this hair dryer on March 23 and it is already broken!  No heat at all.  Not a good deal.
I purchased this item from Super Pharmacy Unica on February 26, 2013.  I received this item at the beginning of March 2013.  I have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving.  Yesterday I had to dry my hair ao I turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on, off switch.  I immediately turned it off .  I sent an email to the seller and I have not received a reply.  I have used Yellowbird hair dryers which I have purchased from other vendors for many years and I have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer.  Furthermore, this seller has not replied to any of my emails.  I want my money returned so that I can purchase a new Yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company.
I plug it and it doesn't work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.
looks good, but stopped working after 3 months, It's beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money.
I found the dryer too heavy and bulky for travel and it didn't fold for compact storage.  Skip this one!
I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.
You can't use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn't kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.
I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.
I purchased this dryer in September of 2012. It is now April 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs. It still runs, but it powers down to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting. I expect it to quit all together soon.
This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!
Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer.
I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either.
I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out. Due to a glitch in Amazon's computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance. Won't buy this item again, and probably won't buy anything like this from Amazon again.
Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.
I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer. It is so heavy and very difficult to hold when trying to dry my hair.  Also I don't think it has the ionic drying it claims to have.
I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs! That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year! So dissapointing
Didn't last 5 months. Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all. Don't waste your money.

I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!
The unit quit working on the lower setting, and it blows more than it heats and dries.  It has basically quit working. My husband has resumed using our ancient one, which we can no longer hang up (which was my impetus for purchasing a new one).  They just don't make things like they used to.  We just threw it away.
The description states there is a cool shot button, but there is NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! Amazon, PLEASE correct this misleading description. I wanted a small, no-heat air blower for medical purposes. This dryer seemed to be the closest thing. I'm returning it, but what a waste of time!
I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn't have a hair dryer during my stay there. I am giving it 1 star, since I can't seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe.
The hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on, plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot, wont recomend it.
Doesn't blow enough air, I need to buy a better one. Great size and I did not have to wait too long to get it.
This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don't waste your money.
****UPDATE 2nd order****<br />As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit.
I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn't want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.
The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The cool air button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!
I used an Andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when I ordered it online, I got a different product.  The product I got is an Andis 1875 but it isn't the same.  I'm disappointed in the one I got because it's not as powerful as the one at the hotel.
The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate.
It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, & that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  The dryer doesn't snap in like it should.
I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable.
Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!
This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!
Two words: noisy and dangerous!<br />It is not necessary to explain noisy...<br />Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.<br />Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.<br />I send my back.
1/10/2013
I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half. There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power. The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air. No idea what happened, but not going to buy it again.
It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it' s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn't like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn't too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.
The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?
I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn't smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn't worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!
We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it.
This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature.  I gave up trying to dry my hair.
Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.
This hair dryer was a waste of money.<br /><br />The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.<br /><br />The warm setting is cool<br /><br />On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.<br /><br />Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS.
I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.
I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!<br /><br />Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price.
Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air. On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm. On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.<br /><br />When set to low heat, it didn't even pretend.
I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.
None available.
I'm a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won't fix it because I purchased it through amazon!
I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....
This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &#34;guard&#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer.
ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH......while I've used Yellow Bird Hair Dryers for years and have always loved them, their high quality has totally deteriorated.  The last two hair dryers have worked less than 2 months.  The first time it happened, I decided to give them a 2nd chance.  Now, this hair dryers has quit heating after only one month of use.<br /><br />Returning the item is expensive and time consuming......I'll just have to find another company and hair dryer.  Surely, there are others that will work for longer than 1-2 months.
This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It's basically useless.
I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I'm not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.
Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.
I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.
I like this dryer.  It's pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and I like that it has three different heat levels but I find that warm isn't warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot.  So hot I can't use it when I dry my childrens' hair.  I use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair.  Cool shot works well and it's a good weight for a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I'm less than happy.  I've had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!  This is a huge problem.  I have changed my rating.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!
I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn't until I kept blowing on it.  Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  I was going to blow on it, but decided I didn't want to risk it blowing up in my hand.
Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend
I couldn't get the hose to stay attached (locked) to the bonnet. Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times. That was enough for me to return it.
I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.
This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.
This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I've had before). Great dryer!
Buttons on the dryer are not user friendly, if you are planning to use often its not a good buy.
I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.
Bought this to replace my reliable Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years.  This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!
When you turn it on setting 2. Its smells real bad..<br />There are no holes for the heat to come out in the sides. Setting. 1 dose not get very hot..<br />I would not recommend this product to know one..
I purchased the Yellowbird in September.  I only used it two or three times a week, and by January it was broken.  The heating element died and now it only blows cold air. I should have kept the cheap hair dryer I've had since high school.  What a waste of money!
This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.
This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it's made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.
I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time.
Have owned this hairdryer for less than six months, and it has already ceased to work.  Very, very disappointed because I like the style and the size of the unit.  It just stopped working; wasted my money!
I can't believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?
I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn't use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,
This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.<br /><br />Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service.
The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.<br /><br />The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.
This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.<br />Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.
I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.<br /><br />Reminds me of the saying: Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day
Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product. Very loud and only dries one section of your head.
This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.<br /><br />Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.
After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill.
I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug.
I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear.
Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It's going back.
I bought this hair dryer for travel to England & Ireland, along with an adapter.  The dryer was advertised as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  That was a FALSE statement.  The FIRST time we plugged it in, it Fried!!!!  It was a huge waste of money.  I will NEVER by a Conair dryer again.
Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair.  Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers.  Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!<br />Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels.
I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  Disposable should be added to the product description.
THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON'T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!
Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you :)
This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back.
This dryer can't compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL
The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.
I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don't know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now.
I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either.
My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !
I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it's very dangerous!
There is no way to adjust the height of the bonnet.  The high setting will burn your scalp and the low setting takes too long. And this is the top of the line???
I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.
Hi, I commented that I get the dryer is in the photo with carecteristicas they offer, I feel cheated and very angry, because I rely on information that you published the photo in addition to the product but it is not, the dryer sent me has nothing to do with what they are offering, I feel cheated, robbed.  are a very bad sellers, they offer a product that ultimately can not sell.
it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it.
I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn't cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better.
in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  Only blow cold air.  What a rip off, i have another professional dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  DO not buy this one.
I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don't buy this - it's junk.
Lumpy clumpy crap...threw it away and went to CVS to get my usual brand. Waste of money. Does not do what it says.
I bought this product because I had a lot of tattoos and didn't want to fade them, however once I got it in the mail and used it for the first few times the pump did not work and it took forever to get the lotion out of the bottle.
this shampoo never worked for my dandruff. even when my hair was wet i can still see the dandruff. this shampoo doesnt work
Altho' they claim to be Dippity Do it doesn't come close. It left my hair very dried out and brittle. I have a bathroom full of barely used jars bottles and tubes looking for the elusive substitute. Hope someone out there can find the formula and market it again. Hurry, my hair is an unruly mess.
I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, & I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome & heavy & too large  & the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.  I am not a happy customer...
My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We'd give it zero stars if that was possible.
the cord is convenient, but its not long enough. and the power is not strong enough (the blowing action).  i would have returned it but i was moving at the time and didnt have time to do it.
This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong.
After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom`s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.<br />Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer.
I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?
I bought 2 of these because I thought they were very similar to what I had before.  Each lasted about 2 uses before I heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on.  No matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer!
Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model.
John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out.
I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now.
I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this.
I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It's completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!
I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!
I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.
This is the second Revlon hair dryer I've purchased in the last four years and both times it had the same problem -- overheating where the cord enters the handle.  This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO.
This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.
The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  Not like toasty warm - HOT!    It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  Don't bother.
This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I've had.  The first two were great--worked for years.  I bought this one on June 10, 2011.  It lasted until September 8, 2011. It's too late to return it now of course.  So I'm out the money and out of a hair dryer.  Very disappointed!
It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again.
This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living. It is super heavy and doesn't even blow hot air. I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it. Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.
We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time?
Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money.
I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times.
I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back.
its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet
Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!  Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:B000LQB5YS T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]
The description of this item is not accurate. It doesn't specify that it won't fit most of the tubs. When I got it I saw that my tub is too high for it, but it was too late - they don't allow a return even if bench wasn't unpacked. Waste of money.
The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.  It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product.
After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I'll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.
This thing is way to small to be useful. If it were a portable, perhaps, but this is a wall mount! It's like a mini hand dryer. Returned it immediately after receiving it.
I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer.
This product should have come with a warning.  Even on the LOW setting, one can get a third degree burn from the heat.
The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn't fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it.
I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day.
i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with it is no longer under warrenty - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer
Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!
We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter's bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week.  She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star.
I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!
The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.
I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January high had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I'm stuck with it.
When I bought this, a real SP62 was shown in the picture. What I received is the one now shown in a replacement picture. It is narrower, with several fewer blades than a real SP62 and does not function nearly as well. Don't wast your money on this piece of junk, it makes the shaver not worth using.
I made the mistake of trusting that the picture on this product page was actually a picture of what I would get.  It clearly says that it is SLS-Free Fluoride toothpaste.  The toothpaste I received is SLS-free, but does not have fluoride.  I'm in the process of returning it.
Very uncomfortable, I can't have it on for more than 5 minutes. I bought it because it was cheap, but I guess you get what you paid for; a cheap product with cheap quality
I have not recieved this product so I can't give an accurate review. I would like someone to contact me, it's been over a month since I ordered this product.
Ordered 2 of the 3500, but received the 3200, which was a lower model, lower priced, by mistake. Somehow, I don't believe that. I feel as if they were trying to see if I would notice the difference. Then when I asked for an exchange, they said they didn't have any more of the 3500s. Sounds fishy to me!
This dryer is deafeningly loud, heavy and unwieldy, and none of the attachments fit. It's a terrible piece of machinery. Don't waste your money.
I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air.
I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job.
Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one.
I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair.
I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.
Don't waste your money, I was two inches away from a girl and nothing. I'm in college and even in class it did nothing, and I put it on right before class.
I ordered two of these and returned them immediately. The suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when I place my head there. If this problem is rectified, it will be a good product. I have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results. These have a flaw in their design which renders them useless.
This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina
This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience.
Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.
I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.
The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.
I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.
I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!
This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use. It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it's impossible to work or write while using it. It would have been nice to know this in advance.  All in all It's terrible
BUYER BEWARE!!! This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase. Hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer, so that I can buy another brand.
I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don't know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped.
I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.
I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.
We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.
I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).
We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great. But just a month before a problem? Unacceptable at any price.
It's too loud, so i didn't used it a lot,(like aroud seven times)the last time i used it, it stop working suddenly and it smells like something just burned, already is in the dumpster.
Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty.
After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.
The real sham!!   Save you money!!   Nothing but slick goo on the lips.   NO PLUMPING!!
This had both good and bad reviews, so i figured i would give it a try. Mistake. Worst shaver ever. I had to take off the plastic piece and just use the blades to make the hair short enough, and it worked for about 2 minutes, and then suddenly all it did was PULL the hair and HURT!!! Don't waste your money.
This product was very dry, it seemed old and really did not work at all, I do not recommend, waste of money
I have been using this conditioner for years including a few bottles I've purchased from Amazon and directly from Bumble and Bumble. The last bottle I got from amazon smelled like nail polish and burned my skin. Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.
I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one. The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair. I am totally disappointed and saddened I cannot purchase the old style and will not use Revlon stylers anymore.
It didn't do much for my hair.  It just feels cool on the scalp if you have braids.  I wouldn't purchase it again.
I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on.
I ordered two.  The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  I didn't even try to plug in the second one.  It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn't work out.
I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/
I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...
I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)
This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.
This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!
I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!
Very cheap! Not much blowing power and very little heat. I can not recommend this product. I forgot to mention it is also VERY NOISY! Spend a little more money and get you a good one.   David/Ohio
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.
Too powerful on high. Not powerful enough on other settings. Needs a additional setting. Extra features (nano technology, ion, etc.) do nothing to change the look or health of my hair. The diffuser doesn't make my hair curly/wavy. (but the one on my old hair dryer did.) Going to try and return.
My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest Jerdon stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that's it.
I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn't start a fire!!
This hair dryer is a waste of money!  Purchase a Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler - $34.99  OR  Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer - $39.99  Works better and saves you a heap of money.  This dryer is NOT worth $139.99!!!
I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.
They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.
The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable.
I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn't impressed for over $100.
I thought these rollers were really cute but I ended up giving them away. I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what, but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either. They might be good for a kid.
i used the roller on a facail scar i have that i cover with makeup, it is not deep but im very self conscious of it. i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery) i would not advise using this on scars.
My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.
$100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not.
First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake.
I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great.  I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on.  The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund.  Bummer!
I ordered the product pictured (Andis 1600W wall mount hair dryer) to replace a similar unit that I have been very happy with.  I was sent a different product that does not match the pictured product and has multiple cords protruding from the base and is unusable to me.  Amazon's rules are that it has to be returned unopened and I ripped the packaging before I realized the wrong product was sent.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.
After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!
Don't waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk.  I am VERY disappointed.      First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!
When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting.   There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark.  Buyer beware.   This item is probably not safe.
I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on.
I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!
I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn't really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn't find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!
THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.
I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers.
This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.
I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom.  Within two months, it went dead.  Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it.  Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked.
I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.
If you value your hearing do not buy this item.  It was so loud that the first time I used it, it was unbearable.  I was excited to have a wall mount dryer, but not worth it at the extreme noise it makes.  I put it into my yard sale box and sold it.
I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware.
I was really looking forward to this. Got it in the mail. Plugged it in and it did not work. I am sending it back.
I'm amazed that people described this product as heavy. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all.
I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you're taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it.
It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, whatever. The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that.
The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn't last long.  Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  If they make one with a decent bonnet, I'm there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off.
I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it.
The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!
We have had this model on our wall for years.  Then we started buying them from Amazon vice other catalogs/sources.  Two in two years.  Current one purchased July 2006 and broke Nov 2006.  These have faulty switches that melt and/or deform.  WARRANTY?????  First one from Amazon did last 18 months or so.
This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.
2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air. It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn't notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.
I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went pop and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).
I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.  On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  I used this once a day almost every day.  I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.
I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  <br />It was very difficult to put back into its case.  <br />I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.
