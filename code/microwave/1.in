review_body
3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it. It was used twice a day. Do not recommend it. go use your money for something more durable. Oh and also big plates do not fit in it.
the microwave turntable and light would come by itself and sometimes when you closed the door.  At first we were able to cook with the microwave but eventually it got to where I couldn't get it to cook no matter what we tried such as unplugging it and it would sit there rotating but not heating.  So sadly we had to send it back.  I only got to use the grill feature once and it was fun.
Came in brand new package but item doesn't work at all.
It came slightly damaged but main problem is that it does not heat at all in any functions.  I have tried to heat a cup of water with Microwave Express, it looks like it is cooking but the water is at room temperature after 30 seconds.  Then I have tried all the functions and none of them work.  The surface light and the vent fan works fine.  I really should try it before I install it.  Now I have all the trouble to remove it and install another one.<br /><br />I order it from Amazon and contacted both the seller Home Care Company.  Since it is Saturday so I will have to wait up to two working days to to get a respond from Home Care Company.  I am not sure what will happen but I am not recommend to buy this product or buy it online.
One of my worst Amazon purchases. I hate this microwave and deeply regret purchasing it.  It is GIANT and heavy, sits crooked on a flat surface, and heats food unevenly!  You can get WAY better for LESS MONEY!!!!!  Shocked, because usually Amazon reviews are so spot on.
I received the microwave and it didn't even work. I didn't have the original packaging so they wouldn't refund me. Brilliant. lol
I purchased this microwave in January of 2015. In July of 2015 the microwave completely stop working. The whole microwave stop working the clock, everything. I want to get my money back. Most microwaves last for years. I have had a microwave that lasted for 25 years. To have a microwave last for only 6 months is disappointing.
I bought this microwave for my parents for Christmas. After six months it died.  My father has been attempting to get his refund processed for the past month and they keep giving him the run around. Don't buy this product!!!
Terrible microwave. doesn't heat the food yet the outside of the microwave gets hot. never had a microwave that gets hot on the outside. working with the supplier to replace it.
Dont buy it!!!<br />The button will be defective after 8 months
The oven  stopped working  1 month after I got it, Samsung is unhelpful, a repair guy came said he fixed it. It is still not working,<br />I have been chasing Samsung for 2 weeks.
It was delivered on Feb. 14, 2015 and has stopped working already. Brand new outlet so I know it's not that. Will not turn on at all and the return window closed on Mar 17, 2015.
This microwave worked fine for some 3 months and then started problem with door. I was totally disappointed seeing problem in just 3 months. Customer service was rude and unhelpful.
Horrible waiting for a refund
it's starting not to work well - takes too long to heat food and leaves cold and hot spots.
Cheaply put together.  Very low quality for the amount of money spent. Spend a little more and get a quality product.
Late Package Delivery. Damaged Item.
Love the size, but didn't last a month!
THIS GIVES OFF A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE BACK.  Simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm.  I then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat.  Since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous!  Especially if you have children.  I am returning it immediately.
This has to be the worst microwave I have ever purchased. It arrived without the internal clock, it is completely missing, so obviously it didn't function out of the box. And I can't get a replacement for another week, this is awful. I know microwaves are just a convenience but having just moved we don't have one and this was timed to arrive just in time for our new home. Total disappointment in both the product and Amazon.
Does not work will be sending back
Missing the turnable shaft. Can't use it without this part. Will alter feedback once problem is resolved.
Unit defective upon arrival, could not be repaired after two attempts and numerous phone calls to Samsung.  Not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having a microwave for a month after purchase.
The only thing it did was cover the spots .  When I turned the microwave on it sparked.  I had waited 24 hours.  It is a GE mstainless on the out side.  Wasn't cheap and was a gift.  Suck it up and buy a new one.
I bought this unit to replace an older LG model that was discontinued.  The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again.
Absolute piece of junk from an unsavory seller. Do not buy this microwave. It was refurbished and I didn't know. The cord had been &#34;trimmed&#34; by the previous owner so it could fit through a hole, quite a surprise. Didn't come with templates to install, had to buy separate. Door closes way too hard and noisy.<br /><br />And now it's dead one year later! I had my previous microwave for 9 years.<br /><br />Total junk. Wish I could give the microwave zero stars.
The cord isn't long enough, so I have to pay more money for a longer cord.
Broke in less then 60 days
Very small. You can find better products in the store at lower prices.
Looks good, only worked a week. First - timer would work but no heating occurred, next dy everything looked like it was good ( lit up, revolving, timer working) but food temp was not changing. Cancelled replacement and have NOT been refunded.
I loved the price on this microwave. So did my 90 year I'll grandfather.  We bought it and he was excited to have back the way he can cook most of his meals. Sadly though, half of the button do not work. He can not set the clock or defrost... I offered to try and return it, but he needs it to cook, and it can do that I guess. But I don't recommend this product at all.
It quit working one month after the date I could return it.  I had been out of town for 6 weeks after I bought it so it was barely used.
Terrible product, broke down after one month of light use..
We have had this microwave for 2 months. It makes the scariest noises, like there is metal in it but there is not. The plate also does not spin properly. Very low quality. Go with a brand you trust!
Very small and very low power. Takes forever to heat anything up.
Try a different brand. I bought this in August and it shorted out in February.  It was nice while it lasted but has a dangerous flaw. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
I got the product out of the box and it doesn't work. It will do everything but heat up inside. I need to ship it back but between work and school there's no time. I will just ask for my money back.
Can someone tell me how to make the door open more easily????????<br /><br />I bought this microwave to sit on top of refrigerator - only place I have for one but the door is so hard to open that by the time I've punched the &#34;open&#34; bar enough to get the thing open, the oven has moved back away from my reach so have to climb on stool and pull it back forward and then put food in.<br /><br /> UPDATE March 6, 2015 -  After buying the nonslip product as suggested by reply to earlier review, the nonslip sits unopened.  Instead, the microwave sits unplugged like a small dead dinosaur on top of my refrigerator.  For 70 years since my grandfather built this little house, a refrigerator has been plugged into the the receptacle behind it including for 20 years my various ones.<br /><br />It took this Danby microwave less than two months of less than stellar service to trip the breaker for the first time.  Even with the electrician installed updated breaker box, the Danby managed to screw it up.  After unplugging the Danby and waiting, I tried again to reset the breaker and it worked.  I now have a refrigerator again but have no microwave.<br /><br />To use, this microwave oven had to be almost punched to open its door.  Then adjust turntable so it would turn.  Then add some more time with the 30-second add button.  Then punch it again to open the door.  Meanwhile, from the punching, the oven has slid away from reach so get out the stepstool  Just touching a numbered button DOES NOT begin to set the time.  Instead, that starts &#34;express&#34; time of minutes for the number I touched.
Terrible product. Cheaply made. Horrible review all around.
I know you get what you pay for, in most cases, but in this case, I don't feel I did. I expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt, but it takes at least twice as long. The turn table rattles, and because of it's light weight, you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right, otherwise you will push it across the counter. Very displeased.
Lasted 1 1/2 years.  Flimsy cardboard inlet cover on the left side of microwave, naturally absorbed some food during use.  Now, this cardboard has somewhat deteriorated, the machine is simply a very large fire hazard.  Catches fire immediately.  Not safe, terrible design.
I bought it, I got it, I tried it, I returned it. 'Nuff said! Seriously, it doesn't appear to be a lasting product.
Do not buy this.  You would get better value by throwing money out into the street.  Mine lasted three weeks, and then became entirely useless.  If you buy one of these and pay for it, you will end up with no money and no microwave.
The handle is attached to the door by two weak screws that bear up against a nonmetallic surface on the door. For my unit, the lower attachment door surface broke within six months and the handle pulled away from the door.<br />I am having a service call take care of it but it looks like a design flaw. Even if I get a replacement door, I expect it will break again in six months. Avoid this model design.<br />Updated Dec 2016: Yes the replacement door also is showing the same problem.<br />Worse: The magnetron failed as soon as the one year warranty was up. Would not heat food. We had a service call and replaced it.<br />It has failed again in 9 months. LG wants more for a service call than the new microwave cost.<br />I would avoid LG microwaves completely. I still have a countertop Panasonic microwave working perfectly after 15 years - unfortunately LG does not know microwaves :)
Microwave looked nice, but did not heat. It seemed like a fan was only blowing cold air. Amazon has great return policy, however, and it made the unfortunate buy easily reversed.
stopped working after 3 months.  total junk.
This item dod not work from the second i opened the nox
[[VIDEOID:567df035967d824cead7d2509901668b]] The unit went out after the initial warranty had expired. The unit was listed as having a 10 year warranty on the Magnetron. The Magnetron (the main engine of the microwave). I jumped thru hopes for weeks (including taking videos of the product shooting flaming sparks) with Samsung warranty service only to be told that they do not have a service agreement near Arkansas. Another week passed and I spoke with them one the phone and they we finally agreed on a partial refund and they sent me an email confirming the amount.<br /> I said fine and went and bought another microwave. They never sent the refund and I called a week later and they said that I had to provide them parts from the original microwave???.......easily done if they had told me this before.!!  They never said a word about it either on the phone or email.<br />This unit should last longer than it did. I feel stupid that I have bought a kitchen full of Samsung appliances. Now if/when these break I will have to deal with the same deceptive people and lack of support again.....Steer clear !!
Came with a huge dent in the side.
I purchased this microwave in February, 2014. It was  perfect size but stopped working within three months.  After contact with Whirlpool via phone and email, I was told by the Whirlpool Product Review Board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where I lived to return it to.  I took it to my local metals' disposal site and provided proof of compliance to Whirlpool.  The Whirlpool Product Review Board then promised repeatedly over a three-month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price.  They apologized for the delay, at one time emailing to me that my Buy Back Check order was stuck in the system.  Then, after three months of promises, Whirlpool stopped all communication with me. More than two more months have passed since then and I still haven't received my Buy-Back check. I don't expect to get one.  Do not buy this product.  You can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon.  In my case, I lost $152.78 and spent many, many hours, time and money doing exactly what Whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty.  Whirlpool apparently does not honor it's warranties, at least not for this product.<br /><br />P.S. 10 days after this review was posted, Whirlpool issued a refund check.
After 17 months there was a popping sound, and electrical smell and it died. We just warmed food up in it. No serious cooking. It is a great size and convenient. Is it worth the price for a year and a half of service? It lost the high setting about 6 months ago but we didn't care too much. You might want to pass on this model.
I feel like I made a big mistake buying this online, I would find a better brand and quality, then bigger one for even less buying it local. I paid over $100 shipping and it doesn't worth it, it's small and at the beginning it didn't heat. It's more or less now but not what I expected!
I would never have bought this appliance if I had known the inlet cover (which seems like just a piece of cardboard) is just tacked on the inside of the microwave.  I've never seen that before.  It's not listed in the item description. I guess I didn't read enough of the product reviews.  While I do cover food in the microwave, it seems like it will get dirty and then damaged by things like butter from popcorn that will randomly leak out of the bag during popping.  Reviews for generic replacement inlet covers of this type say that they may catch fire due to food residue that is hard to clean off.
worked for 1/2 day.
Came damaged, but did not see til after use. Hard to read, just not worth the money. Put in garage and went back to our $59 sams club microwave
DIFFICULT to install, even with two people, mostly the taking down of the old greasy unit. Came with a BROKEN FAN and hence no exhaust. Whirlpool sending a repairman after a week with no microwave. Will he bring the correct parts and be able to fix it?? Impossible to return as box is not a box but styrofoam and cardboard on top and bottom with shrink wrap holding it all together. If you want one of these get it at Best Buy and save $50.00.  It's now a month since we installed the unit and the fan has been replaced (part had to be ordered). Turns out we could use the microwave without the fan. All arranged thru Whirlpool with local repairman fixing it in place.
Product just isn't built to last, when buying these types of appliances best to get something you can unplug and replace.  This product and company just do not hold up...Equipment brand new 5/27/13, installed Aug/13 stopped working 15 months later.
Do not buy this ever. When door closes it automatically turns on and you are unable to start any kind of cooking options, very annoying. Only a 30 day return policy too.
I have extensive experience in refinishing metals; it is difficult to get paint to adhere to aluminum.<br />I power-sanded the entire interior down to bare metal.<br />Contrary to the LABEL claims, THIS PAINT DOES NOT ADHERE TO BARE METAL!!<br />Once dried, it scrapes off with your fingernail.<br />Q: The factory paint failed despite having been primed so how could this paint work with No Primer??<br />A: IT CAN'T!<br />If I were to repeat this process, I'd have first primed it with a high-temp, self-etching automotive primer.<br />Maybe then there'd be a prayer of success...<br />Bottom Line: Unless you're willing to go thru the tedious process of properly preparing AND PRIMING, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.<br />PS:  (2) Cans are required to adequately refinish the entire interior
Appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up. There is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller. So it had to be sent back. My money was refunded pronto but I would rather have the applince
We installed this microwave three months ago and it was working well until several days ago when we set the convection bake to heat at 375 degrees and after 15 minutes the device completely shutdown.  It has completely died.  I set up an evaluation and repair with GE (between 8 - 12 am) and by 11 30 am, they still hadn't showed up and I needed to leave for the office.  BTW, I had a similar experience when I scheduled a repair for my GE washer.  I will never by GE again!  After 3 months, to have problems with a brand new appliance is unacceptable.
SO DISAPPOINTED!! Bought this July 2013 and our kitchen was not ready yet, so we didn't put it in until a few months ago and it worked fine- we probably used it only couple dozen times and my husband went to warm up our daughters food Wednesday and NOTHING! Completely &#34;dead&#34;! Will not turn on, no buttons works, etc.<br /><br />This is extremely disappointing and our warranty was up July 2014!!<br /><br />This is why you do not spend $800 on a microwave and I will NEVER purchase a SHARP product ever again!!!!!!<br /><br />Totally sad and disappointed.
It did not work upon arrival
Never worked well, intermittently stops working - then starts again.  I would have returned this in the first WEEK, but once this monster is hung on the wall, and it's made its first bag of popcorn, who keeps the shipping box??  It finally died after the fan would not turn off, now it's completely inert.  The only bright side is it will fit in my community's GARBAGE CANS.  This unit has been a frustration since installation.
Did not work so I returned it
The button to open the microwave door is too tight. You need both hands to open the door. If I'm not too lazy, I would return it.
Cheap quality.<br />But you always get what you pay for :(
Got it detected right from the box... The lights work, control panel etc, but it doesn't produce any heat! 5 minutes and nothing... Really sad about the quality. Amazon send me a broken device.
poorly built
I purchased this item brand new. I used it only a few times in a period on less than 2 months. It failed in less than 30 minutes of use. Amazon's return policy doesn't cover this item, and nobody keeps the product box so the manufacturer warranty may be worthless (more in shipping than product is worth). Do not buy this item.
We really enjoyed using this microwave while it lasted; however, after 2 1/2 years of use it just stopped working one day. We chose this drawer-type microwave because we wanted to &#34;hide&#34; our microwave in our island for aesthetic purposes, and for this reason, were willing to pay more for it.  If I could do it again, I would definitely have splurged for one of the more expensive drawer microwaves that are available from manufacturers other than Sharp.  Yes, Sharp makes the cheapest version of this type of microwave, but we learned the hard way that you get what you pay for.
works fines initially then as the title says I literally got a puff of black smoke and it was dead.
We purchased the MW in Janurary, our contractor installed it the last week of April, it died two days later and Sharp service took three weeks/ two service calls only to have it go out ten minutes after they left. Amazon assures me that it will be resolved but not the seller. They want to repeatly waste our time and call service, have us wait then what? DON'T BUY THIS MICROWAVE.
I *hope* I sent in my warranty card!  I am calling the company today to request a refund.  I have not liked this microwave at all, and now it suddenly died.  I definitely want my money back.<br /><br />Edited:<br />I called the company and they told me to call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they issued a full refund.<br /><br />I do not recommend this microwave.  It is so flimsy that I had to hold it still with one hand in order to push buttons with the other.  Otherwise, it would slide across the counter.
This is the worst microwave I have ever owned.  It takes twice as long to heat food.  We also have owned it for only a few months and the key pad broke.
After our GE Café microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years GE said it would cost $800 to fix.  So we purchased this advantium oven.  It shipped and would not heat up.  We returned it but ended up getting a Breville countertop for $299 that we like much better.
My understanding is this paint comes 2 ways, 1 with a small brush like fingernail paint and the other in a spray can application, by the looks of this picture I thought this was the brush application bottle not the spray bottle but I received the spray bottle and could not contact the company to exchange it. No one answered the phone but they said to leave a message but the message box was full.
Disapointed in the fan suction. Doesn't seem to be pulling the air from over the stove, almost like there is a ducting leak, because there is plenty of air blowing.
Received this microwave.  The first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off .  It now has no power at all.  I will be returning this and not purchasing a new one.
Had to return it , received less than half the $ I paid for it.  Bulky, odd shape very difficult to find suitable space for it. Like I had an old TV on my counter. UGLY very .ugly
The microwave is sparking while heating we are sending it back for a replacement will hope it works this time
I know I purchased a refurbished unit, but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable.  I'm returning this unit.
After using the microwave for 1 week, it stopped working.  I just sent it back and waiting for a replacement.  I will give sharp 1 more chance.
I bought this microwave in October for a kitchen we are having remodeled.  Got it installed about 3 weeks ago and was microwaving some bacon last night and smelled a funny electrical burning smell.  It is apparently fried (which is what I'll be doing with my bacon until this POS is either fixed or replaced.  The top of the unit was extremely hot and it is just totally dead and unresponsive.  Not even a light.<br /><br />I saw all of the bad reviews but there aren't many drawer microwave options and even brands like Wolf and Thermadore are still produced by Sharp.  Very disappointing.  We'll see how the service from Sharp goes...
I would not recommend buying an appliance such as a microwave through Amazon.  Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems. This is a product category that would be best served by a professional retailer.
One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store.....
This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.
After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!
I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product).
Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.
I received on time, but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill,I'm not so happy
It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.
I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything.
After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500.
Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it! Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck. They say third time is a charm. We'll see...
We purchased this microwave, and then realized that 2 cu ft. is WAY too big for a family of three. We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one.<br /><br />Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping (fair enough), but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee.<br /><br />This is absurd. Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box- we simply opened the top, and then re-closed it. 30% seems like usury to me. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee. I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30%... what are they doing, just trashing returns?<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again, I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE, and reward these unfair business practices.<br /><br />We own a business, and we expect to be treated as consumers, the same way we treat our customers.. that simply isn't happening here.
I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product.
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.
Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me.
Wouldn't work.  Have to return it.  The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door.<br />There is no problem.
Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on.
Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.
This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products
Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step. The actually ad is different than the actual product.
This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0.
This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.
We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.
When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer
Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button.
I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA. Different issues. Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory. I won't purchase another sharp microwave. The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me. I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely. I'm not happy at all.
Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.
We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent.
I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this.
I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut.  I had to send it back.  Darn.  Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem.  I am pleased with Amazon's service.
One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine.
