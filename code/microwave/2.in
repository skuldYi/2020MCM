The finish is nice and matches our stainless steel/black wall oven nicely. However, the button to open the door no longer opens on the first try or needs some help. And occasionally something internal to the microwave makes a noise when the tray is rotating.
microwave worked fine when I bought back in March '15; then a few days ago it would not turn on. Will not buy Danby microwaves again.
When you close the door, it is VERY loud, to the point where it's annoying. If I had known this before I purchased it, I would have bought a more expensive one to not deal with the noise every time it closes. The plastic covering the buttons is already ripping, had it for less than a year. Other than that, it works fine.
I had the older version 2083ST and it stopped working so I replaced it with this microwave - has identical size and older model does not exist.<br /><br />Two aspects were problematic from the prior model - one of the mounting screws was located in the wrong position, thankfully the wall bracket and one of the screws aligned perfectly. So had to drill one more screw. However, the two screws are not symmetrical i..e the distance from the sides of the microwave are different. This is bad engineering, as the center of gravity is not the center.<br />Second, the interior is grey, so we cannot be see the food cooking. Moreover, the bottom of the outside panel is tinted (or black) so unless you are 6 ft tall, you cannot see the very dark interior with very small light.<br />Further, the microwave arrived with the mounting bracket (which was located at the top of the microwave carton) bent; thankfully, we had the older one, we did not have to use it.<br />Overall, disappointed with LG design and there is no backward compatibility with older models.
Not as expected. Measurements are given and are true to what the item itself is. Was very surprised at how big this microwave turned out to be. Very dissappointed as I thought I would be getting a small microwave. This microwave took up just as much space as my current one. It will be going back to seller.
I've had the microwave for 2-months. It used to open easily. It no longer opens when you push the button, you have to manually pull the door open. definitely a disappointment. I hope I can return it!
Good microwave oven.  Priced right. Setting too high will burn everything till learning curve is over.  Expect to burn a lot of food.  8/26/15 re-review  turn table inside quit working.
It's kind of tinny.  Probably just too small . The latch for closing the door sticks so you need to slam the it,  and the whole thing shakes.  I'm already prepared for itt o die, and I will buy a larger and more expensive one.
it was great!! The product came as described...on time and the right product.
Doesn't work on a pure sine wave inverter.
what a huge waste of money!  We bought this microwave specifically because it would fit into the little compartment of my husband's OTR truck.  We've never had issues getting a microwave to work in the truck before... and to make matters worse when my husband called their posted phone number for assistance he kept getting passed around from one 'um, I don't know' person to the next.  We would have returned the microwave IF he hadn't already put it in the truck and left from home BEFORE he discovered that it doesn't work on the power source (why not... we still don't know).  Looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal.<br /><br />We gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it DOES work if you want to use it in a house, but for some reason will not work with the power inverter OTR trucks use.
Loved this when I first got it, purchased after reading really great reviews. However, I noticed that the top got really hot, and several weeks after purchase it got so hot that it shut itself off! This didn't happen again, so I kept it, until a month and a half after purchase I went to open the door to put a cup of coffee in and the top part of the handle broke- saw a piece of plastic shoot across my counter. I am returning and getting another brand- not going to waste my money on another of these cheap pieces of equipment.
I bought for my father-in-law's truck. In terms of its size, it was perfect fit for the truck with inverter built in but as other people described, it's not working properly with the inverter. I think it will work normally with normal AC but not through the inverter. The inverter was rated as 1500W. So $50 inexpensive microwave works better than this one. I had to return it. :(
Working but you need to set extra time to get your food warm up. What I normally warm up in 30 seconds when I had GE microwave oven now takes 1 minutes and 30 seconds to warm. I could have return it but I don't want Amazon to tag me as product return guy! Not recommended for anyone who is looking for fast action product!
Several Samsung appliances looked interesting (features/appearances) when we were upgrading our appliances. Then I found a problem after diving into the customer reviews - the overall ratings are good, but for customers who give them low rates have catastrophic failures, e.g. smoking induction ranges, more than other brands.  We decided to stay away from Samsung brand for our major purchases. As we got most of our appliances sorted out, we still need a microwave. This one, again, looked interesting. I thought ok how bad can it be? Its neither too heavy nor too expensive, let's take a risk on this one. But I was wrong.  Long story short, after one month, the turntable starts to make noise. After 3 repair attempts over several weeks, we were left with the turntable not turning at all. To add to the insult, these 3 repair attempts don't even register in Samsung's system, so even if the lemon law is more and more applicable to my case, I would have trouble claiming it.  Based what I found after taking apart of our broken Samsung TV, I think the company put too much emphasis on using their own components, and some of them are not very good. That could be why we are seeing a pattern of reliability problems across its product lines.
Was extremely happy with the performance of this oven while it worked, however after only 4 months of moderate usage it stopped working completely: it made a loud droning sound, followed by the smell of electrical burning, and then would no longer would heat up anything. I would also note that the mechanism to open the door is annoying- it is located under the control panel and it would be better to have it on the door handle.
Microwave functions as expexted but the inside smells bad. I think it's because the steam from food gets 'trapped' inside. After some use, I can see that the door has moisture droplets. I think this is what cause the bad smell. My old microwave of ten years never had this problem. With this one, I have to leave the door open after use, and have to clean the inside frequently. I didnt have to do any of these for my old one. Will not recommend this microwave.
The microwave did a good job of heating, but had enough problems that I sent it back after 4 days.<br />1. It blew the circuit breaker, which had held up to other microwaves of similar power for years.<br />2. When starting, it made a worrisome bumping noise.<br />3. The spindle rotating the plate often made a grinding sound.<br /><br />Amazon & UPS get 5 stars for making it easy to return.
Item arrived damaged.  At that point return of item became a issue.
Arrived Damaged and needed to use immediately...
Lasted 2 years and then fell apart. The tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own. LG does not care since it is out of warranty. They want to charge me over $100 for a new door.
This is NOT a one touch simple to use microwave as advertised. I bought it because many reviewers stated that the start/stop button was also an &#34;add 30 seconds&#34; button. IT IS NOT. Even the picture buttons are not easy. First you have to push one of them, then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button. That is 3-touch, not 1! I bought this for my parents in their nineties. No way they can use this. It's going back. P.S. The inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean.
Perhaps I just got a bum microwave, but everything comes out hot on the outside and cold in the middle. And there's no sensor cook like the Panasonic microwaves, so choosing the &#34;frozen vegetable&#34; settings cooks the vegetables for 3.5 minutes at 60%, which is less than a third what it actually needs. I got this to replace a faulty Panasonic (since Panasonic customer service was TERRIBLE), but I'm going back to Panasonic.
Kind of weak and weird. It is from France and i worry it may wig out because it flashes.
It's noisy. You can end up pushing it off the table before the door release works. I have to use two hands to open the door, one to hold it from moving while I push the door release with the other. The plastic printed button cover is already starting to show signs of ware after only a few weeks of use. The buttons are hard to locate the center of and actually operate. It doe's a great job on popcorn though.
This microwave OVERHEATS if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn!  Once it overheats, it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available, thus making it take forever to heat anything. You have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down.<br /><br />The microwave works well if you don't use it too much at once.  But for more intensive use, buy something more powerful!!
I liked the microwave, but it was damaged when I received it so I sent it back.
UGH... I wished I had NOT purchased this microwave... the ONLY good things about it is the rounded back to fit nicely in the corner of my counter, the 30-second quick-start button, and having the light stay on while cooking... it's the weakest wattage microwave I've ever had... having to relearn how to do simple things that take 1 1/2 times the amount of time to cook... I miss the traditional power level buttons and being able to key in 15 minutes instead of pressing the start button 30 times.... I do NOT recommend this at all.
Item had tarnished spots on it. Not what I expected for the price. Looks very cheap.
Door doesn't open when you hit the button, you have to hold the button in with one hand and then pull the door open with a 2nd hand.  Buttons are cheapy, just a cardboard panel (comes with a 2nd cardboard panel in French to swap out).  Seems like it heats OK, but the door is a deal breaker.  I'm returning it (I've never returned anything from Amazon, but I hate it that much).
The quality and deliverry where very good but I returned it unused as it weighed too much and the rounded corners in the rear didnt fit my application. Its a nice unit but didnt work for me.
This item is for students in a dorm room, not big enough for a 8' inch plate. It does not take up to much space and it is over price.
I received this microwave and it didn't work! I plugged it in and tried several outlets, but the clock didn't light up and it didn't respond to me pushing any of the buttons. It was really easy to get a new one from amazon and they shipped it very quickly. So far, the second one has been great and exactly what i wanted. However, I had to return the first one that didn't work and the shipping methods were extremely inconvenient. Ups will only pick it up from my house during the day when I'm at work. I had to take it to the post office, but i don't have a car so i had to carry it and walk several blocks. In addition, the max shipping reimbursement wasn't enough, so i'm out another $5 for their mistake.
AFTER I MADE EXTENSIVE PREPARATIONS TO PAINT THE CAVITY OF THE MICROWAVE I NOTICED THE NOZZLE HAD A CRACK IN IT THAT I COULD NOT SEE UNTIL I HAD APPLIED THE PAINT. THIS LED TO DRIPPING AND STREAKS IN THE PAINTING PROCESS. IT MADE A TERRIBLE MESS AND THE RESULT WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS I WOULD OF HOPED . TRIED TO FIND ANOTHER CAN THAT I COULD USE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED NOZZLE BUT WITH NO RESULTS. MY SUGGESTION IS SPRAY SOMETHING TO TEST HOW WELL THE NOZZLE WORKS BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL APPLIANCE.
Magnetron came quickly but the diode was not in the package as advertised. I do not want to install the Magnetron without a new diode.
I bought this thinking common spray paint might be a bad idea. The can warned of the issue of fumes, which in the usual manor, I ignored. I sprayed my microwave, and man did it smell, and really seemed like I should not have been so casual about the warning. So then I thought, if the fumes are so bad, and they lasted for weeks, how good is this crap to be so close to our food, In my imagination, it seems worse than a can of Rustoleum! Who knows, it was fairly expensive for a small can, and it didn't give me a good feeling, but again, who knows?
But I don't like the fact that it doesn't have numbers, I always go over the time I need or it takes too long if I do it manually. It's also too small to fit large plates....
I like the form, fits well in the corner of our counter.  Fairly weak strength but adequate for heating up a bowl of food.  Biggest issue is that it is now DEAD! after only 4 months of use.  Still trying to get Whirlpool to fix or replace it but customer service has not been stellar.  Day 5 after contacting them but still trying to reach the person I need.
The door has a huge dent in it. Makes me suspicious of how &#34;new&#34; the product is or if it is a factory second or something  returned by another purchaser.
I received and installed the microwave. So far, I am pleased with it.<br /><br />It was damaged in shipping (a dent on the top back edge. This does not affect the installation or operation. I noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping. This needs to be fixed. Better packaging and selection of carrier might help.<br /><br />The hardware (toggle bolts) were cheap and just fell apart when I used them. i had to use other hardware to install the unit.<br /><br />The template is a bit off. I had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit. I measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 3/4 of an inch.
The beep is too loud, and the door rattles. Fixed the door rattle by lifting up the back with a folded 3 by 5 card. Good microwave oven for the near deaf. And the digital display is too bright in my studio apartment; I wanted a microwave oven, not a nightlight.
Display didn't light up so unit wasn't usable when it first arrived. GE service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit.  A few days later, the light under the microwave stopped working.  2 issues in less than a month doesn't bode well..  Also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial.  But the good news...options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times (potato, veg, etc...)  are fairly substantial and works efficiently.  HOWEVER.... I wouldn't recommend installing the microwave above your stove. Since the microwave is faced in stainless steel, the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop.  Speaking of the stove, I had much better luck with GEs Caf茅 Dual Range Gas stove.  Bought at the same time. No issues. Works great. Highly recommend stove without any hesitation. Absolutely love it!!!!! Wish I felt the same about the microwave.
I got this because it was touted as a mini-microwave. Of course, I am capable of reading the dimensions, which I did, but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave. It simply won't work with my limited counter-space. I don't know how well it works, because after trying it in various spots, I put it right back in the box. BTW, it is $30 to send back, so make sure you want it before you order.
This is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected. Within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died, an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product. I contacted GE and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem, if I decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call, but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product.
While I love the shape of the microwave (it does fit perfectly in a corner), the turntable is defective and does not turn.  Upon removing the packaging, I immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok, walked off a minute and when I returned the water was very hot.  I thought eveyrthing was ok, so I threw the packaging away.  A few days later, I put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that's when I noticed the turntable was not turning!  I opened the door, checked the wheels it revolves on, replaced the glass, gave the glass a little turn and still nothing.  I tried even placing things of different weights on it, sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop.  So buyers beware, I would not purchase this item.
the items was shipped & handled by UPS.  the microwave was bent in several places on the bottom. it was hard to tell if it was that way before packing or done during shipping.  box was damaged as well.  had we not been working<br />on a deadline for a house showing I would have sent it back for an exchange.  but no time.  it appears work just<br />fine and the dents don't show thanks to the shelf it was placed on.  I would expect a discount based on the<br />damaged product we had no choice but to keep.  I have photos if needed.
Thin metal foil surface piece peeled off almost immediately.  Glued back on, but will probably happen again in other places.  Door is flimsy and bends easily so it requires a careful and firm slam to shut properly or the latch doesn't catch and it won't operate.  Same with closing after use, or light won't go out.  For the wear and tear, I imagine that the latch is what is going to finally break first.  This is the first truly disappointing major brand appliance that I have bought, and it was not the low end model.  We got GE Profile to match our other kitchen appliances. We will be needing a new dishwasher soon. This is enough to make us change brands.
Door doesn't always close right and although it is practically new, it sounds like it is dying.  Would not purchase again!
We needed a small microwave for a small space, and this fits perfectly ... but:  very low power (takes a long time); not tall enough for many things (have to transfer contents to shorter vessels); extremely loud beeping that can't be turned off.
This microwave does not heat as quickly or as hot as we would like.  It has some great features, but its performance is just not up to par for the price.
Looks great. But you have to press Open and Close buttons to open and close drawer. Very delicate product. It is uncomfortable, unpractical to press these buttons everytime. I am sure they will go bad very soon. I will not suggest anybody to purchase this product
I purchased this product because our last Spacesaver finally bit the dust after almost 20 years.  Not the same quality product as previously produced. Door sticks , popcorn button doesn't always spin turntable as indicated in manual.
This PEM31SMSS GE Profile Spacemaker unit intermittently powers off while cooking. There seems to be a power supply issue. If you unplug for a few seconds and plug back in (I have to reset the clock) it will work again until it powers off randomly again. Not sure what is up.  I have contacted the Amazon seller and am awaiting instructions for returning and getting a new unit. I have a old (8+ yr old) full size GE Profile Spacemaker 2 that has never had any issue which I will continue to use until I get a replacement unit.
Purchased this product from Warehouse Deals (Fulfilled by Amazon) which was advertised as USED but in GOOD condition, microwave oven arrived April 28, 2012. The product did not work and the door was damaged. Contacted GE Tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on May 1, 2012, who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage. He also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call GE for him to return. On May 5, 2012 the parts arrived, notified GE immediately and a tech representative  would be responding Monday May 7, 2012. I don't know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by Warehouse Deals or it was destroyed in transit by UPS. I will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it? Just a note...reading all the bad reviews on this particular GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) I'm contemplating  having additional problems with this particular GE microwave. I really had no choice, this unit replaced my old GE Profile Spacemaker microwave (JEM31SF01) that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet; as I required the exact dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers.<br /><br />Update 5/9/12: The GE technical representative responded to my residence Monday 5/7/2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts. The new door still did not align properly with the frame. The rep contacted GE and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly. A decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement. I will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from GE.<br /><br />Update: 5/17/12: A brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation/repair company sub-contracted by GE. One of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific GE Profile Spacemaker microwave oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use. The gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave's more than any other GE microwave. With all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model (PEM31SMSS) what's the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time???..... Mediocre To Put It Mildly. As I previously indicated, I had no recourse, since I needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet, with the correct dimensions/screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers; these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone. In conclusion, I would recommend everyone to purchase a different model GE or a different brand all together.oven (PEM31SMSS) is their #1 problematic GE microwave; for the reason that the inside paint peels-off within 3 to 6 months of use.

After 1 year of light use (maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers), the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything.  The cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth.
The box was somehow very light, and right then, I knew we had made a mistake.      This microwave is almost like a toy.  It is very tiny and underpowered.  We unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn. Well, it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop.  After 3-4 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped.  Forget it. It must have been broken, or maybe just for making things warm, not hot.    We returned it right away. Speedy return system!
