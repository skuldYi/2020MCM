Very nice microwave, great price
It's bigger than I thought.
Was pleased with the packaging and easy instructions to set it up. Worth $55 and that it was 'Prime&#34; order.
Works Really Well
Good price, has continued to work very well since December 2014 (8 months). My only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center. It therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns. I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean. I love using the 1, 2 and 3 settings for one-touch cooking times of 1, 2 or 3 minutes. I really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching &#34;Start&#34; one time. Some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large &#34;open&#34; button is pushed, the entire microwave moves, but I have not had that experience. I seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables, popcorn, potato, etc. I had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn - the microwave didn't sense a need to stop cooking. However, it's fine for baking a potato.<br /><br />I do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior, which contributes to the 1.4 cu ft interior volume. But the size is right for me regardless. Certainly this was the best buy on Amazon for my purposes.
Although it slides when you open the door, this is a great product. The size is perfect and it works great.<br /><br />Because of how my kitchen is designed, I cant push my microwave against the wall.  If you can, then your microwave will not slide.
Solid microwave for a good price.
I just received mine and, when it's running, you can see the interior light shinning through a gap on the top corner. Not sure if this is normal or safe, so I've submitted a question about it. For now, I'll give it a 3 star review for looks and the slightly annoying BANG! the door makes when it closes, pending any heating and an answer to my question. I'll update then. I'm attaching pictures of the gap.<br /><br />UPDATE (9/26/2015): Well, the gap doesn't seem to be a normal feature, but it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way. I mostly use it for heating up leftovers and it works great for that purpose, have not tried it for any serious cooking. The loud door is far more tolerable now after a few uses, barely noticeable. Updating my review to 4 stars, won't do five only because of that gap.
We ordered it for a boat that we are rebuilding not real sure how its going to work yet. But it fits where we wanted it just perfect and we like the looks. That is about all I can tell you at the present time.  Terry
Needed one in a hurry and my teen bought this. It's pretty powerful. It looks as if there are many brands that are actually this same machine.
Purchased this for college student and it has not been used yet. Still in the original box. Looks nice, however.
Our microwave was working fine, but had a number of rusty spots.  I cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal.  There was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior.  i.e. to give a uniform color appearance.  The only issue is that it took a week for it to air out.  You could still smell it a couple of weeks later.  But eventually it went away.  Overall, I'm happy.  The 10-yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too.
For the low price, it works very well. Compact and nice looking.
I wonder if they will ever produce a microwave that only beeps once!
It's large but heats food up quickly and is easy to use. Only 4 star because of it's size. Make sure you have room. Mine is above my fridge which makes the push button to open the door ideal rather than pulling the door handle.
Low power but gets the job done, and good value for the money. As a den microwave or as a small office microwave, this is perfect and an excellent value. Takes a bit longer than larger units due to lower power, but works well.
We replaced our over-the-range microwave with a range hood. We needed a small microwave to install in our pantry and this fit the bill. It holds a 12&#34; plate and has multiple power levels for cooking, but we use it mostly for rewarming. It does take about twice as long as our old microwave but that's okay. One feature I really like is the one-touch button for speed cooking. Start will zap something for 30 seconds on high. 1 = 1 minute, 2 = 2 minutes, etc. That is quick and handy!
This is a nice looking unit. It arrived right on schedule and was well packaged, so no damage. Plus, all the features seem to work. I particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit. My only complaint was, as noted by a couple of others, the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places. Fortunately, I didn't do the install myself, a pro did it--or the micro would have been on the way back to &#34;home&#34;! The unit matches my other LG appliances, so, I'm pretty happy. I'll update this after I've used the micro for a while. Ta. y'all.
Not a power-horse but great on space for my tiny kitchen.
Getting good use in a small office, and working well.  Seems to be well built, and holding up well in a tough environment.  Good value.
Just a month, no issues, no particular shortcomings, nothing really outstanding, just working as a reasonable microwave should.
It's OK
Perfect for our backroom.  Very pleased with the product.
What can you say about a part that fits specific applications? It replaced the broken turntable motor in the microwave. Now the microwave doesn't burn things on one side and leave the rest cold. So, it's great that the microwave is works again. The motor was considerably cheaper than having to get a new microwave, which is the best thing about it.<br />It was easy to swap out once the cover was removed from the bottom of the microwave. Getting to the turntable motor in a counter top microwave takes a chisel (or snips, etc.) to cut the tabs holding the cover panel to the sheet metal bottom of the oven. Then it's just a case of removing one screw and unplugging a connector. Just reverse the process and its back in place and you are in business. The cover plate may need a screw to hold it in place when you reassemble the microwave. It wasn't included with the motor, but is easy enough to find at the hardware store (or scavenge from some old, unused electronics).
I have had this microwave for about 5 months now and it is working perfectly. The settings on the front are easy to use, I regularly use the 30 second option on the &#34;start&#34; button, and it cooks evenly. 1100 Watts is good enough for everything I cook and I like the fact that there is a light when you open the door. I think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but I do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute. Plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying (personal preference though). It is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen. I like the look of it too - clean lines! I knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless I hold it with the other hand. Perhaps putting the microwave on a non-slip mat would solve that issue.
So far so good! I'm not enamored with the constant beeping when things are done, but when one of my kids use it, it allows me to give them an evil stare & ask them if they are using the microwave. When I was looking to buy a new one, I had my evil redheaded stepchild  (Relax!, he is over 21) check out the specifics of the 2 machines. He said they were identical. However this one is slightly larger & performs much faster than the one it replaced! Still, not a problem, but I have to wonder why the old one took much longer to perform the same thing;!
Very nice microwave, good size, programming buttons very clear and easy to use. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the door closure. Maybe for some folks, having a door that latches so tight you have to hold onto the oven itself when pushing button to open door is a good thing but not for me. Really wish there was a way to adjust this-a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door! And one small note...I haven't figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer, my old one you could and find that to be a feature I miss-have written to Danby to ask if I'm missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond. UPDATE: Danby took over a week to respond but it's as I feared-you cannot set timer and still use microwave to cook-OH WELL but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave. And make sure that when you check a review for Danby microwave, it is for the actual model you are looking at-Amazon has chosen to lump ALL Danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 1.1 and 1000 watt, some reviews are all the way down to the .7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews.
Tiny as promised! Not very powerful, which goes with the tiny, but it seems like they should be able to fix that in a future model.  The button to open the door requires a LOT of pressure.
good
This is a very good microwave. it is perfect for places with limited counter space. It is small. You won't be able to cook full meals with this microwave but it is perfect for basic microwave uses such as heating up frozen vegetables and reheating leftovers. So far it has worked just fine.
works well and an an advantage i had not thought of is that the 5 y/o can use it with supervision.
i am please with this purchase. its the only portable close washer i have purchased so i can't compare products. e spin cycle isn't veryeffective but it washes well. you can put a pair of man size jeans and a couple of tshirts. at one time. i purchased a two year protection plan just in case.
i have not used it yet but it looks exactly same size that we have.  hope it works well, then it's a great deal!!
Good I love it. Hoping its lasting. My friends and family was excited thought I changed my dishwasher
Works well, but same gripes as other reviewers; no handle, slides too easily.
The push buttons are ok but occasionally have to push harder to operate.
Overall, like it and would recommend. One issue is that, of late, the door requires several pushes to open. I've cleaned the area, can not see an obvious issue but am concerned that it may worsen. So far that is the only negative I've experienced. I'm contacting Samsung directly on this one.
I bought this M/W for use in an apartment after reading the good reviews on Amazon. Functionality and performance and even look-wise, this has been a great buy. No complaints there. But a couple of important downsides to this microwave...It is LOUD and keeps beeping even after the timer is done. there is no 30 second timer which is already mentioned in some of the reviews/Q&As. So, that is a fact..just confirming here.
This microwave is great! The size is perfect for my small studio apartment (not a lot of countertop real estate) and the stainless steel finish looks really nice.  Sturdy construction and works very well. The light turning on when you open the door is a nice feature. I docked it a star because the buttons are a little more difficult to push than other microwaves, but not too big of a deal!
Fits my counter top (I have a small apartment) well and I am very pleased.  Does not take up a lot of room and seems to work very efficiently.  Thank you.
My mom really likes it
Just as advertised.  Nice looking, easy to clean and large interior .  MNo problems thus far.
Big enough to put lots of things in, but doesn't take up too large of a space on the counter. I can say this honestly as I have less than 9 linear feet of countertop available to stick anything onto.
Fit my microwave cart perfectly and works really well.  Great microwave at any price.  I really think it's more powerful than 700 watts though.
after sanding rust out and washing cavity, paint when on with no problem.  However, jt did take several coats to cover the exposed sheet metal.  So far the plastic wheels on the plate rotary device have NOT picked up any of the fresh paint.  Wife loves her &#34;new&#34; microwave.  Paint was totally dry within an hour.  We left it outside over night with the door open to get rid of fumes.
Very satisfied , looking great, AAAA
It is a cute microwave that fits into the space I had.  It is a little smaller than I had imagined and the &#34;crome&#34; on the outside is a little hard to clean.  I works well and I am happy with it.
It is everything I wanted it to be. Got it for my 92 year old mother who had a microwave die on her. So far she is very happy wit it. Time will tell if it is a substantial product, but the price was very good.
Fine product.
Wish the cord was longer, but I really like the way it fits into the corner of my countertop. I have a small kitchen & it doesn't take up a lot of space.
I looked a long time before I found this microwave; it was very hard to find one where the interior light goes on when the door is opened (not just when it is in operation).  This one does, is logical to operate and fits nicely on a counter top. The only thing on my wish list that is lacking is power; it's only 1,000 watts and I would have preferred 1,200 watts.
Pretty simple
very good
Works as expected. Great value.
It came with the diode which may have caused the problem and I would not have known it. Good call!
Great size.  I only use a microwave to reheat things.  So nothing more then 5 minutes or so.  The simple display to add time by 30 second increments is what allows this to be so small.  If you need complicated time inputs with numbered buttons, this isn't for you.
Great value for the price. Full array of function controls. Takes up small amount of counter space, yet has plenty of room for a full 10 1/2&#34; dinner plate on its motorized turntable.
Nice microwave arrived quickly was actually 40 dollars cheaper than in the local big box stores.  very quiet, sleek look, Grill function works well. so far we've had it only a week but it seems to be doing the job as described.
It works, nothing fancy, no bells and whistles. It's small its basic and that's all I needed. Big enough to fit a dinner plate and small enough to push into a corner, perfect.
The color description on the can is &#34;snow white&#34;, the reality is this paint is an off white color.  My GE microwave is a bright white color and this paint did not match.  I still used the product and it worked well.  If the directions are followed, the spray applies evenly and covers well with several coats.  For my needs I liked this product better than the touch up paint with brush application.  You also get more paint with the spray can.
Works well! Great small size! Easy to figure out controls!
Great price, shipped in good speedy time,  a very small dent that we decided we were not going to complain or worry about!  Oven was mounted, and neither of us felt it was worth taking out and starting over!!!  Works great, convection or micro- wave!!
I have been very happy with the microwave. It fits the space I have perfectly and so far has been working well.
i hate that opening the door moves the microwave towards you and out of its place. Thats my only complaint.
Bigger than I thought but still works well for my needs. Fits right under my bed, for easy storage and use. Definitely a perfect space saver microwave.
Have only had it about a month, but so far so good.  It is smaller than my last one, but I needed something that would fit in a small space and it's hard to find compact-sized microwaves.  I just use it for warming up things and it seems to be doing the trick.
This model is a newer version of one that we had for many years. It fits perfectly in the custom cabinetry that we have. It looks great and functions really well. We're very happy with this purchase!!
Installed easily.  So far I've baked a chocolate cake and cookies with convection method. Both turned out perfect. Microwave works as I expected.
So far I like this microwave.  It seems like good quality materials and also well put together.  It's doing a great job efficiently heating.
Exactly what i was looking for. i would of like more selection in the color
Excelent thanks
I did not care for the way the bottom of the microwave was not finished.  I need a better finished bottom.  The filter on the bottom does not fit in tightly enough.
I would have given it five stars if there was a handle on the door to grab on to so that's why I decided to give four stars.
Fit perfect in cupboard, nice sleek design..easy to clean..haven't used the grill part yet but expect I will soon.
Turn table motor works well. Only problem, it only reverses counter clock wise at random.  Doesn't automatically reverse direction at every start.
We have only used for quick cook and reheating and it does both jobs just fine.
HAVE HAD THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT A MONTH NICE SIZE AND WORKS VERY WELL AND  QUIET  SHIPPING WAS A LITTLE SLOW DUE  TO BEING OUT OF STOCK BUT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT MADE HER IN  USA  FROM WHAT THEY SAY ....
I just got the microwaves yesterday and will add more when I know more.  BUT so far it is good. I like the look and the ease of use.  I cannot wait to try the grill feature.  The grill feature does make it heavier, but not too much.  Also when comparing microwaves remember to look at the wattage as this is a bit lower than some and so cooking times will be a bit longer.
...it's been very good. It replaced a much larger unit but this is a much better size. Different controls of course but they're acceptable. The one time I used the dinner plate feature, it was spot on. The reason I knocked off one star (considered two) is because the turntable ring and plate dislodge easily if a heavy object is slid across or not centered when setting down.
Solid, nice size...working fine so far.  Good price and quick service.
This is a very nice microwave at a great price! I wish it was 1,100 watts instead of 1,000. That little bit does make a difference! The only thing I can say is a slight negative is the noise on start up. It is kinda loud. But I would definitely recommend this microwave!
I like the performance of this microwave.  It was bought after our other one caught on fire.  It fits perfectly on the counter in the corner.  The only problem with it is the button for the door.  It is very stiff and hard to push.  I thought it was just me but my husband complained about the same thing.  It's not enough of a problem for it to be returned.
Had it for a while now, so far no malfunctions. Decent size. I do wish it was a little quieter - the beeps are very loud, and it would also be nice if it had one of those buttons to press to just add 30 seconds to the current timer count, but overall pretty good.
Entry level, small and powerful. Was here in 2 days with prime. Best way ever to shop. Recommend both the microwave and Amazon prime!!
Covered well  prep was most work<br /><br />One can did the entire cavity
Adorable and it works great. Not as powerful as my old one but the added counter space more than makes up for it. My covered Corningware fit in it perfectly but my plates don't. a standard 11&#34; plate fits mine are 11.5. not a big deal for me but if you reheat on plates you should measure them.
First time I've purchased an appliance through Amazon. They delivered it on it's SIDE for some reason (I guess the arrow pointing up was confusing?) but it works nonetheless.
It is a fine microwave but I am not that happy with it.
Like it very much- heats evenly and easy to use.
For its price it's a good little microwave. It does slide when I try to open it since it's very lightweight and doesn't have any rubber feet. The inside is smaller than I'm used to, but I knew that when I purchased it. I was looking for small to fit in a smaller space. I don't use it to really cook only reheat so it totally meets my needs. I only gave it 4 stars because it slides across the counter when I open the door. Hopefully, I can add some rubber feet to stop this.
My niece was thrilled with the microwave being delivered to her door.  Nice size...works great!
Very nice microwave.  I only use it to reheat things.  SIze is nice, does not take up much counterspace.
Great for microwave purposes, looks great and easy to clean.  Grilling, didn't seem to work well as shown.  Maybe practice makes purpose.  Dont throw away the instructions if you want to try other cooking methods.
Really great microwave. Since living in an apartment in NYC meant small kitchen space, we needed something to fit accordingly. This microwave was the largest smallest microwave! Perfect for our usage - simple, functional and good value. This microwave is rather quiet-- love that the beeping noise ends after a few distinct beeps. My old microwaves beeps forever.<br /><br />Easy setup, easy usage and easy clean up.
Good quality product and good price. The button to open microwave door is very hard to push, I'm sure it will get easier with use.
Good unit but a rough sound when operating.
Works well.  Would like to have an add 30 sec or quick minute option, but overall, is very solid for the price.
Works great, looks good but sticks out from cabinets. I had it installed and they had no problems what so ever.
This replaced a 12 year old identical model that finally quit. While I considered a more recent model, the convenience of installing a microwave with the exact same dimensions and mounting hardware is hard to beat. There are a lot of buttons that I will probably never use.
Works exactly as advertised in my GE Profile microwave. Color match is darned near exact. I prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible. Then sprayed in many coats to get coverage. I removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips—could just as easily remove a star from the painter (me). The paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth. Nonetheless, I will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the GE oven. Cleans nicely, and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago.<br /><br />1 can will likely cover about ½ of a microwave interior adequately. Since my oven was flaking, I needed about this much coverage or slightly less. If I had stripped the entire interior, I would have been short.
I bought Danby Designer 1.1 cu.ft microwave to replace my aging and faulty Sharp Carousal which served well for 7 years. On comparing against my Sharp unit I found this few pounds lighter. But the marked difference which was noticed is the noise level. While Sharp was really a rowdy teenager this guy is really a silent one. When measured with smartphone sound meter app, the operational level was about 65dB ( which is like normal conversational level). I payed $40 premium for the stainless steel model which was purely for aesthetic reason - my previous microwave was plastic and I did not have any 'material' issue. As for functions, besides the common controls like popcorn,pizza,beverage etc there were a few other controls which I find useful. There is a power level button which lets you step down from full power level to say 50% level. There is also a kitchen timer control which works independently of the cooking control - $5 timer will do that function but having it there help reduce kitchen clutter. There is a two step cooking, which essentially step down the power for the second round - yet to try this feature.<br />Instead of the push button door release a door handle would have made it look more industrial. The wheeled base where the tray rest and the spoke on which tray slots fits looks a bit fragile, probably because of the lack of finish on the molds.<br />Overall this is a very elegant and industrial looking microwave and so far a great addition to my counter top.
Not english .. I cannot read...
We've had the microwave for only a few months.  The door design is similar to our last microwave that lasted only two years.  We chose this brand because they seem to make a superior product.  So far it heats well, it's easy to clean and has had no problems.
Saved me the purchase of a new microwave!  Can't argue with that!
Love the compact size. Hate the fact that the turntable keeps slipping off the base. You have to readjust it every single time you use it.
No problems - as yet.
I have had this Microwave for about a month.  I'm still learning how to use all it's features.  I own two microwaves, and this is my secondary one.  It is very quiet when it is cooking.  The one negative I have noted so far, is that when an item is done cooking, it beeps three times, but if you don't open the door or hit stop, it will beep about once every minute.
I love this microwave so much! Aesthetically, it's the coolest kitchen appliance I own. It's also pretty powerful. That said, it's kinda small inside and square plates, 16 oz coffee cups, and popcorn bags can pose difficulties (e.g., when the popcorn bag starts to fill up, the tray stops turning). I still wouldn't trade it in!
The Grill doesn't toast as well as a dedicated toaster oven, but the Microwave is fast and easy to use.  The fast preheat and the convection oven cook accurately and are perfect for smaller households.  I haven't used the air fry yet.
god model
I am satisfy
Gift for sister - she's happy with it.
A little loud, but is a great fit for our family of 7.
Direct replacement in my RV for the original that lasted over 15 years.  I hope I get that same life out of this one.  All of the previous reviews were spot on, in the fact that the new one is very hard to get the two mounting bolts to start (took about 40 minutes) and the new models fan and motor are far louder than the old one was.  But the unit works great in all categories.
It's a great microwave, easy to clean.
Nice microwave
Works very well. Happy with the purchase!
This little microwave is almost perfect.  I'm having a kitchen remodel and didn't want to build in a microwave, which--let's face it--is mostly a giant water boiling machine.  I got this little one to use during my remodel and I plan to use it once my kitchen's remodeled, too.  The time goes up in increments of 30 seconds, 1 minute, 1:30, 2 minutes, etc.  I wondered if that would work for me, but it's just fine.  I also found out, however, that the power goes up in increments 25, 50, 75, 100. Sometimes, I use my microwave to &#34;soften&#34; butter and I need the lower power of 10.  If the microwave offered increments of 10, 20, 30, etc., it would be perfect.  Because it doesn't, I may have to take this one to work and get myself a different microwave for home.
Seemed to work fine in the house but didn't get along with my RV inverter.  Returned.  Bigger than most 700 watt units,<br />.  Handle sticks out quite a bit so not a &#34;space saver&#34;.
installed it for PEB7226SFSS, and it looked great. The only problem was the screws came with it, for mounting to the bracket,  were too short. I went to HD purchased longer screws and screwed in perfectly.
this is a unique microwave in style and performance.<br />it doesn't heat as high as most, but the size and shape is<br />what sold me.  it fits nicely into a corner of my counter.<br />i don't use a microwave for much other than reheating<br />things, so this for me is perfect.  it is a very basic microwave.<br />i really like that the light goes off after a bit if you leave the door open.
The small size and the unique design with the rounded back are what I love about this microwave. Unfortunately, the quality is just not great. The glass plate got a chip on it within the first week of using this. I've never had that happen to me ever before with any other microwave. The plastic layer over the buttons has bubbled up and looks really cheap. If these two things were fixed I would give this 5 stars because it's just a perfect size.
a little noisy but works good.
The Microwave works Great. I really like the fact that it has a little smaller outside dementions than similar Microwaves of this Power Rating. ONE COMPLAINT. They Offer 2 extra months of Warrenty Coverage, if you register Online Immediately. I did and They didn't give them to me. Also, the Coverage starts on the day of purchase not day of receipt from UPS (AMAZON). The additional Warranty I purchased from Assurant Solitions DOES Start on the day of receipt & is CHEAPER than The Warrranty from DANBY. I wonder WHY?
I bought this to replace my decades year old GE microwave.  After reading all the reviews, this microwave convection was close to top with the added feature that it might actually work with the existing GE wall mount; it didn't.  Overall, this seems to be a nicely designed unit.  I am using convection cooking all the time now, or even starting with microwave and ending with convection to warm things I won't nuke.<br /><br />It seems to me that a proper review would be done a year from now, and not before the plaster has dried.
Just a little too small for me.
it lacks power but generally speaking it does the job
Easy to use.
I bought this for an easy to use microwave for my elderly parents. They love it and use it way too much now.
Powerful for it's size, fits anywhere (especially above refrigerator).
Great for Dorm rooms
This is a beautiful microwave that happens to match all our other appliances. I bought it to replace a Samsung that had burned out. It does an adequate job but the food, cooked for the same length of time is not as hot as with the Samsung. Each microwave had the same power but the Samsung was more powerful. I should add that it was also more expensive! The Whirlpool is a good buy!
Works great and saves space in our tiny kitchen.  It's small though - cannot fit anything larger than a dinner plate or taller than a large coffee mug.
Did the job and has held up even after a year of use; it has extended the life on the microwave.
Exactly what I needed to repair my microwave at about a 1/4 of the price that most appliance parts retailers wanted.
This was rated fairly high by Consumer Reports, and usage over the past month or so has borne that out. It is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly. The basic controls are fairly intuitive, though apparently I have to set the power level before I set the cook time, rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave. The special features, like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam, are things that I don't seem to be able to get the hang of. After playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad, I was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items. I don't like the push button opener; I think that is what will break first, and then I won't be able to open the door. I do not regret the purchase so far. If the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase.
For the price it a nice unit, easy to use etc. Only negative is the door  latch button is hard to push/open
This little sucker has been heating up our food reliably for going on a year. It fit into a cabinet space that no other microwave could fit into. Yeah, it's a little underpowered, but you get used to that.<br /><br />It fits a whole plate, which is nice, but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate. Full-size popcorn bags have this problem for example.<br /><br />But overall, great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space.
This is a good turntable place fo rmy microwave perfect fit.
Gets the job done and it was a great price!
As advertised, compact, works great. Figuring out how to warm without presets is kind of complicated. Not impossible however.
It fits nicely into the corner of the counter...doesn't take up as much counter space. But... it does not cook as fast as a large microwave but for popcorn and heating coffee it does just fine!
Very well made with stainless interior. Cooks well but has few bells and whistles, which is fine. Four stars because visibility while cooking is not what I'm used to.  Still a good deal for the price
This microwave works well on a counter top.  My previous Microwave had a analog timer so I'm obviously not too picky about microwaves.  It should get the job done on most foods.  The quality is a bit iffy though because the first one I received from Amazon was half &#34;caved in,&#34; literally!  It's really lightweight and simple in design.  A good inexpensive option for regular everyday heating.
Wonderful product. My first time using anything like this for microwave repair of burned areas. I was not sure if it would work, but to my surprise it exceeded my expections. I highly reccomend this product.
Still learning how to use it.
The template was completely wrong on where to put the screw holes on top, resulting in too many holes being drilled into the shelf above.  Other than that, this was a solid purchase.
Love this product works fine
Love the form factor, but a bit difficult to read display
This is a truly compact microwave.  I wanted something with a small footprint but functions well.  This oven has fit the bill.  It sits in a corner on my counter.  As some have mentioned you can't program the time you want but have to hit the controls to add 5 seconds or 30 seconds.  This aspect is not ideal but also not big large problem.  I am very satisfied with this purchase
Love it.
Cute little m/w. Have been working good so far. No issues. Good enough for a couple to warm up/heat things in small quantity. Takes a little more time (quite natural as its just 700 watts) but reasonable enough. Overall, a nice buy.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to operate. Many quick options, Cute little and looks sturdy, a big space saver if you have small kitchen space.<br />Cons: None so far.<br /><br />Overall, a no non-sense simple m/w for day to day use. Serves the purpose.....
I was looking for a very &#34; small&#34; microwave for my rv. This one is perfect and looks very nice
..turntable fits an average size tv dinner, barely.  It arrived in an Amazon outer box, with just a couple wads of paper. Thank goodness the regular packaging was done proper (tightly packed box from manufacturer). The Amazon box was tore up. No markings to say  &#34;fragile.&#34; Luckily it worked. It appears to function just the way it should, no issues. Clean design, easy to read display. I would have gave it 5 stars, but a pass down the microwave aisle at the local Walfart saw similar or even better values for price and size.... although just a few dollars on price.
Super simple to use (no bells and whistles) and tiny, tiny footprint.  Works in my small kitchen, so I'm happy with the purchase.
Never realized how small 0.7 cu ft was going to be, but now I do! Ah well, it works like it should, just don't expect to put a huge plate on their.  Quick touch buttons are the best. anywhere from 30 seconds to minutes with one touch
Please see above..am pleased with my choice, good value and works well so far.  Timer seems to work well..Good booklet with directions.
This product came super fast. And exactly as described. The only down side is that it doesn't get as hot as it should. I do live in Korea and have to use a converter box, so that might be what's effecting it. Other than that it is perfect!
Microwave performs as expected and was a good value. Only complaint is with the alarm that sounds when the timer is complete. 5beeps is a bit much and the alarm does not stop even if you open the door until those 5 beeps are complete. Small issue but annoying all the same.
its a microwave and it works like a microwave. Nothing fancy has the quick start buttons. Was the cheapest 1000w one I found and I have no complaints.
So, I needed a basic microwave, nothing fancy. Let's face it, no kitchen can function can live with out one. Don't know how the settlers survived lol. Anyway, it arrived in about a week in perfect condition. And far exceeded my expectations. It looks just like the pic and even displays the time, and has a timer. It cooks very well also. Over all yes, buy it, you won't be disappointed.
I was looking for a more compact microwave because I don't have a lot of counterspace.  This works pretty good for that.  The only thing I didn't like is that the cord is on the back right side instead of in the back middle.  So I was unable to put the microwave in the spot I wanted because it wouldn't reach the outlet.
This is pretty roomie, has plenty of power and fits just about anywhere.  It looks like a TV though and is a bit loud.
I bought 3 of this. if you sand/clean you microwave throughly, you only need to buy 2 to spray it
Worked great.
So many negative reviews on this site. I agonized over getting it, but it fits my space so I did.  It works just fine and I'm happy to recommend it if you're stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave. It is a decent microwave for regular use.
We use these in our break rooms where they get conciderably more than use than they would in a home enviroment. They are a great product for the price we seem to get on average 3 years use out of them. The more expensive ones we tried lasted about the same amount of time.
If I had read the reviews before purchasing this unit, I probably would not have ordered  it.  After reading the reviews, I was worried that I had made a mistake.  However, I have had it for several weeks now, and it is working just fine.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because the door is a little hard to open.  But for the money, it works quite well.  I'm pretty satisfied with this microwave.
Oven came quickly and well packaged and protected.  Gave it a try last night. I'm in the middle of some inside renovation, and used the microwave to have something quick to eat. Things I like about this oven,  is the  pull to open door, and being able to heat food using 15 second increments.  You can also adjust cooking times while the oven is in use. One other feature I really like is that the power cord is not ridiculously long.  You can plug this oven in and not have the cord showing from behind the microwave.<br /><br />This is a very solid oven and am pleased with my  purchase though it is a bit higher than most models.  Curved design of the oven also makes cleaning quicker and easier.
Its not working for what I buy this, but use in my home kitchen. Looks nice. Easy for who not use so much microwave. Want for my husband in Freightliner on road, have hot food
Purchased this ... Good for the price can't complain . I would recommend this to a friend if you need a simple small microwave !
This will fit in a small place and has room for a full size dinner plate. It is very sturdy and well made. You could go to Walmart and get a 40 dollar microwave and that might fit the bill. But this will last.
I bought this microwave to fit into a cabinet. So the measurments were most important to me. Other than that, it has everything I want in a microwave oven. Full size to fit big plates. The carousel works great. Easy controls. Several one push buttons for 1min, 2min, 3min, even a 30 sec button. Readouts  are very bright and easy to see. The only problem is the cabinet. When I got this via UPS, it was packed inside of a plain brown box. Inside that box was the box that the microwave was shipped in. In that box was a full surround of think styrofoam blocks along with some plastic and paperwork. When I took it out of all the wrapping, the cabinet was loaded with dents and one side was slightly collapsed. I don't know how this could have happened unless it was done before shipping. But, why would they ship something they knew was so beat up? The only reason I can think of is......people buy them to put in cabinets like I did. I paid 99.00. Great working microwave. Terrible cabinet.
The parts were just what was needed. They were the correct part as identified. There was no variations and therefore installed just like the parts that were removed. Have been working just fine since installed.
Works, great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it
The microwave is really OK as for the price; if you don't need to have a 'fancy', big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes - it's perfect!<br />I tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn - it also works well.<br />CONS: a little bit noisy when it's ending preparation; popcorn button doesn't work well - program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped<br />PROS: easy to use; small; built-in kitchen timer; cheap
Good unit<br />Easy to install as I. Was replacing old unit<br />Color was as expected it to be when opened
Purchased this microwave for my husband's semi truck.  It would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck.  Fought with it for several days until I decided it would work great here at home!!  I love that it takes up so little room on my counter.  It's perfect for the one or two person household!!
Love this new Microwave; fits perfectly on my small counter and is very efficient for what I need; heating a cup or my heat pad... The only negative I have is that the plastic cover on the bottom front panel is starting to deteriorate already and I've only had it a couple of months... Otherwise love it!
This microwave isn't perfect but it's perfect for me. Some folks would think it's a little loud, both while running and the beeper. It takes a little longer to heat than larger units but that's to be expected. Those are minor issues for me. It's just the right size and fits nicely in the dead space of a corner. Has freed up counter top space. It heats frozen food just fine and that's all I use it for. If I were asked what needs improving, I'd like to be able to key in the heating time rather than push the button up and down. And backlighting for the buttons. Overall, it fits my needs.
all the feturers of the big microwaves in a compact size<br />the handle makes it easy to open without spilling food
We don't use a microwave all that much and didn't want to invest counter space in one.<br /><br />With a teenager who is now heating things up for himself, it made sense to get one and this small-footprint model seemed to be a good fit.  It handles our largest dinner plate and seems to heat things well.  It is s little taller than it looks in the picture, but it fits our family's needs quite well.
We needed this size and the Danby works.  The controls are a little quirky, you have to put a &#34;0&#34; in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time...  took some getting used to.  The only real design flaw is that, unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open, you have to pull the handle on this one.  And the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn't open.  This can be a pain.  But if you need this size, the cooking is fine.
This microwave will fulfill my needs at this time.  I am well pleased with the wattage of this microwave, this microwave replaced one with much less wattage.
Verry good appliance don't have any of the issues i saw posted before i bought it only one thing should warn buyers it is a green appliance so no in microwave light sorry but other than that works like a charm.
Okay, it's not the most powerful thing ever, and there are a few things I would change about the design, but this little thing handles all my microwave needs and has freed up a significant amount of precious counter space in my very cramped kitchen.
the microwave has work very nice, a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook.
I had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged. After the third one was installed it looks great and works great. I got it just before Thanksgiving so I used it as an oven so I then had two ovens which came in very handy.
This replaces an old Sharp Carousel we use as a second microwave and lasted 14 years. My daughter called it microzilla because you had to shorten cooking times somewhat because it had so much power. This one carries on the tradition.
This microwave is very cute (there's no other word to describe it!), and as promised is good for small spaces. It does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves I am used to, and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the + sign to increase time, as opposed to just typing in the number. So far I have had no issues, and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice.
Had one about 20 yrs. that was losing power.  New one has added features that are helpful - esp. sensor cooking.<br />Price is up there esp. for stainless steel.
Microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected.  Keep in mind that we do not cook in it... we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers.  We like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the + button that adds 5 seconds at a time.  The only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut.  We need to push it up a little to get it to close.  Other than that, it was a great purchase for us
This is a good microwave that fits well in the corner of the kitchen. It fits a full size dinner plate.
only one I could find to fit in space.  couldn't use all the others because once installed was unable to open door because it is next to an extended wall.  I hunted all  over for a microwave that the door hinge was about an inch from side.
It is a basic microwave and so far working very well.<br />It fit perfect over our oven range.<br />My husband and his friend's help needed for taking old one out and setting this microwave up.<br />Door feels very light (we are used to the metal one) so we get gentle on it.
but it is a little deep for where I have it. Beautiful and stylish. Easy to use, with sensitive touch screen.
This product fits into a small corner counter space that I have, and it &#34;looks&#34; nice...but truth be told, I could have saved money and bought a small rectangular MW and put it on the same counter, although it wouldn't have looked quite as nice as this one does.
I bought a used micro that works great but needed a little &#34;tweaking&#34; for paint touch p inside.<br />This did the job!
This is a great design concept.  It gives you more counter space.  I was worried about it making soup spill with jerky loading, but I haven't found that to be a problem.<br />The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the interface is a bit clumsy.  For pretty  much everything, it requires too many key strokes to get it doing what you want. It's like the old days of operating a VCR. way too complicated. It's like you have to keep the manual out on the counter if you want to do anything other than run if for 1, 2 or 3 minutes.  defrosting = difficult .. timer = difficult... resetting the clock = difficult<br />In summary: as long as your key objective is to get the microwave off of the counter, and you only plan on using it to reheat things at max heat, then you will love it.
We used the Dacor labelled version of this aplliance for 10 years before it gave out. Found out this is the exact same appliance as the Dacor, at half the price. So we ordered this one, but returned it immediately because it  had dents, so obviously had been dropped, and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old Dacor when operating and I was afraid it had internal damage. Amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return. I then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system (vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product), a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying. The microwave I bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one, but I don't know how important an extra 250 watts really is. 850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years.  Could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long? And the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will.<br />Anyway I think this is a pretty good product, particularly if you use the convection function a lot. One word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside, remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line. Our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion. The exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease, causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron. Also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean. If we had done those things our old Dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer. We considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease.
a little bulkier than I expected. bigger than the old one I got in the 1990's but fits on the counter
This microwave has many good features and fit great into our over-the-counter space in our kitchen. It was easy to install and has been very reliable. GE makes good products, but don't expect it to last forever. We replaced our old GE microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one. The primary reason I bought another GE Spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave. I did not want to have to replace my cabinets to have a different sized microwave!
Same model that we had before with some cosmetic changes.  The old one died after 6 years.  Reviews placed it at over $160 for repair.  Bought the old one because it fits on shelf over the stove.  Bought the new one for the same reason.  Hope we get at least 6 years out of it.
The only thing I would chande is the push handle.  Sometimes it diesn't work the first time and it feels like it sticks.  Otherwise, a good product and good value.
I found it cheaper at Lowe's by $150.00. Too late now, it's too cumbersome to return.<br />It pays to shop around.
Like other reviewers, I had to purchase this particular GE Spacemaker microwave because it was the only larger one that fit into the existing built-in cabinet in our kitchen.  Other manufacturers are missing the boat if they think everyone wants or needs a huge countertop or above-the-range microwave, or a teensy weensy underpowered microwave. There was no need for the industry to completely change size standards for countertop models.<br /><br />That said, I've only had this microwave a few weeks; so far so good.  I like its features and performance.  It's a bit smaller inside than our previous full size GE microwave.  The previous GE fit perfectly in our microwave cabinet, but its magnetron went out in a scary way after about 6 years of use.<br /><br />So far, only drawback to new microwave is that the instructions say to keep the front of the microwave 3 inches back from edge of countertop so it won't tip over when the door is open.  Not enough space to do that in our built-in microwave cabinet, so have to be careful not to inadvertently put weight on the open door (with my hand), or the whole appliance starts to tip forward.  Don't recollect seeing that information in the description of this product on Amazon, so please be aware.
This is a good product. It replaced our previous Profile Spacemaker II model which lasted about ten years.  We're not exotic microwave users and choose the Reheat feature 99% of the time.  The new model works well, although my wife thinks our previous model had a hotter reheat temperature because we more frequently have to press the reheat button a second time with the new model.  We also find the location of the Clear/Off button confusing and sometimes fumble around looking for it.  It should have been placed in an easier to find location, like on the top or bottom corner.  We like the turntable which our previous model didn't have and think it helps heat the food more uniformly.  Overall, we're pleased with this product.
Works as advertised. Easy to follow installation instructions and cooks great. Of course, the holes from my old 'Ewave' did not line up with this model.
I spent hundreds more for another &#34;Name&#34; brand and this one is as good.  Cant beat this for the price I paid
I like the look, the ease of cleaning, and the fact that it does everything I need a microwave to do without taking up much countertop space.  The only drawback is that the interior is so small I sometimes &#34;bump&#34; coffee cups trying to put them in for re-heating, spilling liquid that drips straight down to the control panel.  After having a full size microwave, this one takes some getting adjusting on my part!  I gave it 4 stars because I can't heat pancake syrup in it, the bottles are too tall.  All other things I use it for, such as making popcorn, melting butter, reheating left-overs, etc., are just fine.
Had 6 months.  It works fine as a microwave, but the control pad is a little small and you have to be careful where to push to get the button you want. Window is hard to see the food through, and it always fogs up making it even harder. I like the favorites program, but they should build in an automatic delay between stages. This is because if you program 1 min at high, and 1 min at 50%, you actually get about 1:15 straight high. A third stage would also be nice.  I don't like the push button door latch.  It takes a lot of effort, and if it gets dirty, is hard to clean because it pushes in 1/4 inch without any effort, making wiping it hard. It should have s simple handle.
I expected this microwave oven to be smaller than it is. I was hoping for a small microwave to go in the craft room for my wife because she spends a lot of time in there and her coffee often goes cold, and instead of having to get up and leave her work, she can reach over and reheat her coffee. I didn't want something that takes up a lot of space. Well, this is about as small as I've seen, but I thought there were smaller ones. We don't have a lot of extra space so we bought this one. It works fine, I personally don't like the bright blue LED clock on the front but my wife doesn't mind. It does what it's supposed to.
Plus - I've had this microwave installed for about 4 months now and I really like it.  It cooks evenly and in a predictable way...much better than the traditional turntable models.  The coolness factor is high and its easy for the kids to use.  I love how it fits in with my new kitchen.<br />Minus -  it's pricey for a microwave.  Considering, the price I expected it to have a few more quick features, like a 30 second reheat button (it will do 1 min).  The open/close mechanism is noisy and closes with a &#34;clunk&#34; .  The special cooking features are complicated to program so I have yet to use them.<br />Summary - It was worth the splurge.
VERY smelly!!!<br />Be sure to scrape all rust out with steel wool, paint scraper, whatever it takes. The directions were minimal...I googled for more information.
This was to replace a bad microwave in one of our condo's kitchen - it fit perfectly and looks good. Thank You
If you're looking for a space saver, this is the microwave for you.  If fits so well in the corner of the counter top and I have twice the space I had when my old bulky clunker was still on the counter.  I haven't found a plate yet that doesn't fit in the microwave and only one conatiner was too tall to fit, but even that wasn't critical...just used another container.  The power is suffiecient for warming and cooking most foods.  I do wish it had a few more watts; around 1000 would be perfect.  Over all the compromise in power is well worth the additional space.  Controls are very simple although, I do wish I could increase the time in more than 30 second increments.<br /><br />Service was terrific!  The first unit arrived damaged by the shipper.  Replacement was fast and problem free.
Looks and works great so far... the vent is really nice and powerful too... a bit loud when you set it at the highest but sure does work
When our old Sharp &#34;over the range&#34; started to die (14 years of service and the display had become very dim and door starting to crack with quite large chips falling off we decided it had to be replaced). Finding an over range (gas) with convection and a good extractor fan proved difficult and so we decided on this Sharp product. At 71 lbs and with different mounting points from it's predecessor it was a difficult installation task - could not have been done by one person on their own.<br />Once in place however it is the greatest ! It is better designed than the one before with 2 extractor inlets placed to handle the heat from the gas range very well , a large ceramic turntable that is easy to clean PLUS it can be selected to &#34;not rotate&#34; which permits bigger dishes to be used as needed.<br /><br />Best of all it has a &#34;keep warm&#34; feature that allows warming serving plates as well as keeping unserved food ready  for &#34;seconds&#34; without the whole reheat cycle.<br /><br />Great product - would have given 5 stars but for the physical difficulty of installation ( in fairness that would have probably been much the same for any brand)
I have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions, but so far it seems like a good machine.
Used this microwave as a built-in. I had a specific width opening in some shelving and wanted the most cu ft and features in this width. Only been using it for a couple weeks however it has met my expectations. The body of this unit is black so if you are looking for an all stainless for countertop use this would not be the one.
I am very satified with this microwave although I was surprised when I saw two small dents on the door.  This of course does not in anyway hamper the workings. I would recommend this product for its efficiency.
This arrived incredibly fast and features were as advertised.  However, do be aware that the height is listed as 15 and 1/2 and this was a primary consideration as I was replacing a microwave in a tight space.  Sure enough, the front is 15 and 1/2; however, the unit slopes to 16 and 1/2 at the back.
Whirlpool's description of this microwave is spot on.<br /><br />The only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad, but there really isn't space given the compact design.<br /><br />We have oversized dinner plates, and they fit in here with very little to spare, which means this microwave is perfect for us.
Bought to fit in an 18 kitchen base cabinet, hidden behind a door. 1000 watts would be better, but this is the only choice for my requirements. I like the simple controls, as I use it only to rewarm leftovers and melt butter and chocolate.
I bought this fridge for my college son who lives on his computer. The only setback is that he says it doesn't accomodate larger cans of drinks. Other than that, he says it is the coolest invention!
I received the item before the expected date-package and it's contents were intact, no issues at all with delivery.<br /><br />I used it the day I received it; after reading the many helpful hints in these online reviews, it was very simple and easy to use. It works great for me, for small loads in my apartment-I live alone and don't have large amounts of laundry to wash.<br /><br />The tube they supply to fill up the tub didn't fit onto my faucet, but I have a plastic pitcher I used to fill it (three pitchers full, easy peasy). When in use, it sits right on my kitchen counter and the drain tube empties the water directly into my sink. The Panda is fairly quiet, if I have music or the tv on, I can't hear it at all.<br /><br />It's really been a huge help to me, and I use it often. I am planning on getting a mini-electric dryer as well, then I will only have to visit the laundrymat once a month, if that. I highly recommend the Panda-it's just so darn cute, and works like a charm with small loads.
Everything so far seems to be working great.  We've only owned it for a few weeks but other than it being just a bit noisier than the old one we replaced, we are very happy with it.  Also the power is the same as the one we replaced it for but it seems to take about 15-20% longer cooking time than the old one.  The size of the microwave is larger than the old one, so maybe that is the reason it takes longer to cook.  Other than that I would still buy the same microwave over again if I had to do it all over again.  Great deal for the money.
We bought this oven based upon our son's usage of an earlier model.  There aren't that many drawer microwaves available.  Why buy a drawer microwave?  Well, the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house!  Her arguments were as follows:  1) no need to lift or inspect foods over her head, 2) made space for a vent. While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above (top), our new house didn't have any vent.  So, all cooking fumes were vented into the room.  With this oven, we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood (above the range).  Still, not perfectly ventalated.  I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave.  Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker, but a problem or extra costs for others.  In addition, I had to add an electrical outlet.  Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer, but maybe a cost for others.  After the installation, simple enough, the drawer didn't want to stay closed.  That is, you push the close button and the drawer closed but re-opened immediately.  I was about to call for service but I did the following:  push the drawer closed manually, that is by hand.  This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay.  So, no service call required.  The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table.  Dispite this, we are happy with this model so far after about a year.  Shorter people may like this oven a lot, and, it is REALLY COOL!  So, I would recommend this oven.
I love this microwave.  It takes up barely any space on the counter, and the cord is well hidden behind it.  It works fine for just heating things up and defrosting.  The only thing to be aware of is that this really is a tiny microwave. You can fit a full size dinner plate, but there is not a lot of height inside.  I couldn't use my microwave rice cooker in this because it was too tall, so I had to purchase a counter top rice cooker instead, which doesn't seem to work as well.  Other than that, this microwave looks good on the counter and does the job.
The Haier Microwave was exactly as discribed and installed easily. It replaced a 10yo Hotpoint over the counter which began the fail and finally threw electrial flashes and died. As a low cost replacement, the Haier was the best I could find.
I ordered this Microwave to replace my 15 year old GE microwave/vent hood which had finally given up the ghost (after multiple repairs). I was pleased that I could install it myself using the templates and instructions included. It has fewer features than the expensive model it replaced but it works quite well and includes all the important features including the ability to use the existing vent or to vent into the room.
I bought this particular microwave oven because it would fit in the space over our stove and the price was very good. It's worked well, without any problems since I bought it a few months ago. My only complaint is that you can't have the timer going and cook something in the microwave at the same time. I've never had a microwave that couldn't do that so that's a little disappointing.
I looked everywhere for this microwave.  I had the same one a few years ago and wanted the same one in white because I wanted  to match it with my new kitchen.  It is not too big nor too small.  It was the perfect depth for my shelf in my kitchen.  Reliable appliance!
This looks good and does what it is designed to do. My main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy, but as I only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal.
I wanted a microwave that took up as little counter space as possible, had sensor cooking and was easy to use.  This one fit all that criteria and had a bonus:  a Beverage key which I use a lot to heat water to the perfect temp for tea.  This microwave is perfect for my needs and I'm very happy with it.  The only downside is that the quality is only average.
This unit is a replacement for an identical item that arrived with concealed damage.  I notifed Amazon around 3pm the day it arrived and received word that a replacement unit had been ordered and it would take several days to process the order.  Two hours later, I received notification that the replacement unit had been shipped!  It arrived at 9:15 the next morning!  Outstanding customer service effort by Amazon.    This microwave replaced a 2002 Sharp model identical in size, power and other features.  The first thing I noticed is that it takes 30% to 40% longer to heat compared to the older model, even after 8 years of use.  This is across the board, not just on certain items.  Also, the keypad has been reconfigured with the start and stop buttons situated in between rows of other buttons instead of separated from other buttons as on the older model.  The buttons are also smaller and it is easy to push the wrong button if you get in a hurry.  I will say it is a more attractive unit and a lot quieter than the older model.
As good or better than i hoped! Lots of options, fan is great. It is noisier than my old one (as per other reviews) but really...it doesn't matter that much.
The installation dimensions in the install guide are exactly right.  I worried about trusting them, but they worked very well.    Looks real nice, works well, and was very easy to install.    One issue, When the drawer closed, it made a squeeking sound.  I figured it was going back into the box and getting shipped back.  We called Sharp and they sent out a technician who diagnosed the problem and ordered a replacement part.  We'll have to update if things go south with that, but so far, I appreciated the customer service.    Four stars because of the squeaking drawer, but not one star because the customer service was so good.
Microwave is very spacious; works well and is very powerful...  We love this unit.. Arrived with faulty circuit card; would not heat up.  Sharp Warranty personnel were here within 2 days and fixed it.
Right size, cooks everything, Fast and convenient.  Just right for my needs. Can't go wrong with the deal or the unit.
This unit was a replacement for a slightly earlier model that failed.  It is nice that the LG over-the-range family generally uses the same wall-mount, so installation was easy as a replacement.   It works fine, though if you are a heavy users of microwaves, I am not sure what the real durability is, but since we are light users, the prior model lasted several years, and expect this will too.
I bought this microwave to replace my previous Sharp R-1449.  This one is deeper, more plastic, and slightly more powerful.  It seems reliable (only have had it 6 weeks), has a good vent and good stove lights.  I wish it had a night light and a switch to stop turntable rotation though one can get around it by removing the turntable. My biggest disappointment was that it utilizes a different mounting plate than my previous Sharp microwave.    I gave it four stars b/c it does the job and it was inexpensive compared to other manufacturers. Incidentally, mounting instructions were very good.
I bought this oven to replace a Whirlpool of equal size. I like the LG. It's a little more powerful, and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well. It's a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts. Get those right and the installation is no big deal. It does take two people to horse this 60 lb. appliance into place while starting the bolts, threading the cord etc.    It took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and I was a cabinet installer in my youth. Still, no big deal.    Tip: use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet.
The microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition.  We have tested it to make sure it works.  It was just installed so we haven't used it a lot yet.....completely happy...excellent Amazon service as usual.
I had a same model of microwave which worked for me about   4to 5 years very good and that was the reason I ordered the same brand and model again .  the new one so far has been very good too but the one way blocking door over the exhaust fan was noisy which I swapped it with the  older one and fixed the problem overall is very good and I like it.
After one year the turntable plate cracked while we were making a bag of popcorn.  Very strange indeed!  Now trying to find a replacement as I really miss the food items turning while cooking!  Other than that it is still working in top notch condition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  This microwave died after only 2 years. Was hoping to get more out of it then we did.
Great help in the installation, smaller oven size than ge or sears. Display could have larger numbers. No handle to open door.
This microwave works pretty good.  The sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly.  The only bad thing I've seen is that it's got a rather large footprint.
Its a pretty big and heavy unit so having someone around to help mount would be a good thing.  I found that sometimes the clips in the back have a little trouble popping in all the way, unless its lined up just right.<br />I didnt like the wall mount screws a whole lot as well as the fact there is only 4 to hold on the whole bracket (they note that you should have at least 2 in studs).  They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across, so what I did was located two studs, drilled some 1/16th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk (5) 1 3/4&quot; drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall.  I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove.<br />Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place, the bit can easily destroy the screw hole :)  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 1/2&quot; self tapping bolts.  So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard.. but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall!<br />As for functionality, the microwave is nice and powerful, the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door (you punch in the settings when you open it).  A note of caution, dont put anything in it without the carousel tray to heat.  I had a small paper nacho bowl in there and it almost started the glue on fire in 20 seconds.<br />Another note... The carousel tray does not ship in this box well, mine arrived broken in half.  My only option was to ship the whole unit back (weighs like 80 lbs).  I lucked out because my old microwave was a Sharp and the carousel tray is identical.
