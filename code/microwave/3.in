Quiet, but does not seem like 1000 watt power.
I never used this for my wife insisted we buy a new microwave after I bought this. I did contact GE and they gave me a 20$ credit  and said not to worry about  paint peeling off. Tell that to your wife! That was OK because I read some reviews which made it sound alittle difficult to use.
Unit is lighter than expected. Cooks as expected. Door latch is hard to push, but not hard enough to move unit while opening. Light comes on as unit runs, not as door opens. Buttons are convenient for cooking, but read directions, some difference to set power levels, than other microwaves I have owned. Went with this unit, due to reviews, size and price.
Works well enough for my purposes. Just the right size. I dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds (start) and minutes (number buttons). It's also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy. What brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves – super tiny, and the handle. While this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well, that doesn't make for a good combination for opening the door. So I have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door. I think this could be solved with some super rubber feet, but I shouldn't have to add them myself.
Microwave and reheat function works well, but it is a little slow and worse of all it has no way to quickly add 30 seconds or a minute. You must always either select a mode or manually enter the cook time before starting.
The microwave is fine but the shipping was terrible.
First...it's pretty big (something to considering if you live in an NYC apartment). Second...the door makes a pretty loud noise when you close the door. Third...there's a noise coming from the unit which sounds like the glass plate is shaking every time I use it. Overall, it heats up my food. That's all I really need.
It's a microwave. The buttons feel cheap.  Also, before you purchase go somewhere and see a microwave that is .7 cubic feet. Literally can't even microwave a hamster it's so small...
I like Sharp Microwaves. My mother had one for 40 years and I have had one for 30 years before both required repair. My microwave needed a new magnetron and fuse which I fixed for $125.00. My mother's microwave had to be replaced as we could not find all of the replacement parts we needed. Hence, I purchased the one above- almost an exact replacement. It works very well and is easy to use, but I am not happy with the outward appearance. Too much black and it looks cheap compared to her original one.
Not as fun as I thought I would be
Came damaged and was returned
I wanted a product that was a microwave and toaster, and this claimed to be in the description.  It does not toast!  The manual is awful, very little and very confusing instructions.
Perhaps its my fault in not researching the low wattage but indeed this microwave takes an exorbitant amount of time to heat items
The button pad gets very easily torn up. I'm not a heavy handed person.  Owned this a few months and the pad is torn up. Looks like something was chewing on it. Especially the start and clear buttons.  Would have spent a bit more for a sturdier pad. Otherwise it works great and looks good.
Arrived in timely fashion and well package.  My complaints: It is noisy when it runs.  Also the plate that rotates sticks and makes a horribly loud noise as if something is going to explode.  I worry that this oven may not last long.  The door also requires a &#34;hard&#34; push on the mechanism to open the door.  l would not purchase this again.
This thing is small and that's what we needed. But it is weak. I've used some really awful microwaves before, but this thing takes longer to heat my food than any of them. It eventually does the job though, and the price was right.
I've had this item for about a month. It was purchased to replace an aging micro/convection that I've had for about 8 years. While I've not yet used all the various settings,  I have used the microwave function. More to that in a minute.<br />When I received this item, the box didn't show any damage, but the micro had a sizable dent in the exterior upper back part of one of the side panels. Returning the item seemed like a huge pain (one of the problems with ordering this type of merchandise from an on line source), so I called Amazon customer service and they gave me a credit for the damage.<br />On to the performance of the unit.... It does work well as a microwave, however it is louder than any microwave I've ever had in the past (including the micro/convection that I bought this one to replace.) Is this a problem associated with the dent in the housing? Perhaps.<br />Now, the reason I've only used the micro function? I just haven't had the time to dig thru the manual to figure out how to use the other functions. It really is not very intuitive when it comes to ease of use. Also, while I knew that it had a wheel for time adjustment, I didn't realize how much I'd gotten use to simply entering the time digitally. I know this sounds like a petty complaint, but one would think that as technology advances, we wouldn't be taking backward steps in product design. I'll add more as I have the time to decipher the instructions for more functions.
it is a bit small. Also the sound it makes when it is done is ear piercing.
Too small and too heavy, but works as expected.
The Danby microwave works well, but it is somewhat flimsy.  I've only had it for a few months and the plastic coating on the keypad is already bubbling and peeling.  However, the microwave cost less than $50, so for the price, it's a fair deal.
Works fine, but somewhat lacking in some features.  The defrost selection begins at  1/2 lbs..  In a single person household, I often need to defrost smaller amounts.  I buy packages of pork chops, vegetables, etc. and split them up into small packages and freeze them.  Also, my previous microwave had a 30 second time add feature which I used more often than the 1 minute add feature on this microwave.  One minute is often longer than I need and if 30 seconds is too short, I could always push it more than once.  That microwave also had several fan speeds and light options.  The lower fan speeds were useful when I didn't need the higher speed and reduced the rather irritating high speed fan noise.  These restrictions are mostly just somewhat irritating and, overall, I'm not dissatisfied with the unit.  I also found the installation instructions somewhat difficult to follow. Mainly, I had a few parts that didn't seem to go anywhere.  My previous unit (different maker) only lasted 4 years which was a disappointment, I hope this one lasts longer.
smaller than your average microwave
I got a good bargain on this. Looks good on the countertop. Though small in size with limited power, It works perfectly well and serves the purpose.
I purchased this for a gift and didn't open the box. The recipient informed me that it was defective.  The door wouldn't close. I chose to have it repaired locally, as it was heavy for me to take to PO.  Needless to say, it discourages me from ordering large objects through Amazon.  I can't speak to the good qualities it may have.  I just wish the quality control had been better.
Very large and over priced! What happened to the small cube microwave?
there were some issues about the exact measurements. other than that it fit well.
Nice looking microwave. basic features, no 30 seconds key, but no big deal. The only complaint that I have is after it finishes, it will constantly beep until you open the door or hit any key, otherwise it will keep beeping 3 times forever every 30 seconds.
Really short from top to bottom; lots will not fit.  That is probably my fault; measurements are probably in the description.  But, the glass round tray comes out every time we use it, and it very hard to put back in to rotate properly.
Cute, affordable and durable.. just weaker wattage than any microwave I've used. Also doesn't fit a standard size dinner plate.
Noisy and hard to open but I needed a smaller microwave with a somewhat higher wattage.  The wattage isn't quite what is advertised but okay.
Larger footprint than expected for such a small microwave.  Appears to be functional enough.
I never got this item even though I examined it and placed and order for it of wehich I cancelled, it probably works better than the Oster OGB8902-B0.9 That I got instead but has electronic problems.
Good value for basic microwave
A bit noisy when running and the box and unit was damaged in shipping, though not affecting functioning.  Holding up well at the moment.
This microwave is whatever. It heats up your food, but that's about all it has going for it. The bottom three numbers don't work. They never have since I bought it. Also, the paint is already chipping on the bottom inside. It's really compact though, so it's a good choice if you have limited counter space.
Steel case was damaged on back side.  Was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet.  The only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare VERY careful.  The microwave/oven features are great.  Very easy to use and looks great!
WOW am I ever surprised! The product descriptions states &#34;Spacious 2.0 cu. ft. interior Accommodates a wide range of meal and snack items&#34; this spacious interior is in reality 1.4 cubic feet!!!. LG's claim of 2 cubic feet include all of the little indentations on the sides and bottom So perhaps this unit has a 2 cubic feet capacity .. if you laid it on it's back drilled a hole in the door and poured in 2 cubic feet of liquid! Well so much for honesty in advertising ... I'll write another review when i actually start using my small microwave but for now I feel duped.
Really tiny.  Not very powerful.  Both of those were to be expected.
First I want to say I have no issue with the microwave.  It is a great little machine.  The turntable is nice and not usual for small and low powered microwave.  My issue is with the price though.  It is not worth over $50; even that would be too high.  It is almost more worth it to find a cheaper one directly from Wal'mart etc.
Very basic, works fine, a little noisier than I like (both mechanically and the door) and is a great price for what you are getting. For instance, the microwave I am replacing cost about $800. I wouldn't say the same negatives on that one... but it cost 8X as much. This one is a good deal if you aren't looking for top-of-the-line.
Doesn't clean well, and retains odor...but it heats very well!  Vapors accumulate on all interior surfaces (door panel, interior housing).  This may account for the retention of odor.  Worth a try as microwaves go for general, light to medium use.
It works fine but can get pretty hot.
Not really a good product. Sometimes turns off itself.
As described
Since we only use a microwave to heat or reheat food, I decided to forgo all the bells and whistles when our last one stopped working. This one was the lowest priced one that met the color, size and wattage I wanted.<br />Pros: Heats food as expected.<br />Cons: Noisy<br />While the microwave works fine for it's intended purpose, it's extremely noisy compared to our previous microwaves and occasionally makes an odd rumbling sound which may be from it not sitting level since one leg is shorter than the others. I attempted to adjust the leg without success so tucked a piece of folded cardboard under it to keep the microwave somewhat level. Also at first the door was extremely difficult to push open, but that has gotten better with use.
It works fine, but we hate the push to open button.  We end up pushing the whole microwave away....(you need to use your other hand to hold the microwave in place).
It is small but works well. I liked it
Door hard to open and microwave has shut off a couple of times and it's only 6 mos old! Waiting to see if this happens again!
Paint itself seems to work well -- depending upon WHERE you paint.  If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.  Some foods, such as potatoes, generate a lot of steam/moisture in the oven -- which drained UNDER the turntable.  I didn't always notice the moisture, and that's what caused the rusting in the first place.
Good solution for a tight kitchen. Slightly underpowered but works well.
Because I was stung by the fatal malfunction of the digital display on my 1 1/2 year old Samsung microwave, this time I opted for a semi-manual operating system.  It's a mixed blessing.  Hopefully, it will last longer, but it's cumbersome.  Want 10 seconds to melt butter?  Nope, 15 seconds only.  Want to use the timer?  You must press the button THREE times to activate it.  The convection cycle seems slow, but works. These are little things, and I'm hoping this microwave will carry me through at least 4-5 years of irritation.
ok
Received with damages in the back and on the sides. Contacted seller with no response. I needed a microwave so I didn't return the item. It is overpriced, but I was desperate because my old microwave stopped working. I gave it 3 stars because I think this is a refurbished item that shouldn't be claimed as new. Also, the handle is made of plastic, not stainless steel as it appears to be. The Tape (made to look like stainless steel), keeps peeling from the heat of the range, and exposing the plastic more everyday. I have had this microwave for 8 months now, and half of the tape wrapped around the plastic handle is gone. It is functional, but looks really tacky.
27 trim kit isn't 27 inches. It's 26 and 1/2 so there was a 1/4 gap on both sides  Would look nice if it fit
Fast shipment, decent product.  Doesn't cook evenly.
It's OK but not perfect.  The 'buttons' are hard to see in dim light and offer zero tactile feedback.  It's way to easy to hit the 30 second button more than one time if you're not careful.  I stuck some small felt adhesive pads over the buttons I use frequently. That helped quite a bit. You can find them in low light and when you press it you know it.
The door wants to catch.  When you push the numbers on the keyboard, they seem cheap.  You have to push hard for them to work right.  This is the second one of same microwave we've had.  Purchased it so wouldn't have to remount hardware.  This second one seems like it's a reject or a second that a store is trying to get rid of.
Nice small size for an out of the way spot on kitchenh shelve under counter.  In opening and closing take great care as it easily l tips forward.
This is my second unit, replacing one installed in a custom-built cabinet.  I purchased this one solely for dimensional compatibility.  When working, this microwave is excellent in all respects.  It runs quietly, the controls are intuitive and it boasts a number of cooking programs that generally perform well.  Unfortunately, after 5.2 years in service the first unit failed.  I was told the failed component was the magnetron, an expensive part, so I simply replaced it.  I hope the premature failure of the first unit was an aberration.
Device ok after only 2 weeks except that operating touch panel is not the work of genius and not really touch.<br /><br />Big floppy paper templates for wall and overhead marks should be on or glued to stiff cardboard with perforations for marking. Author of directions too expert to convey simple things, failed to consider ceramic tiles on walls need carbide drills. Directions were accurate tho clumsy.
Overall, the appearance of this item looks great! However, I just installed this and there seems to be a problem with the drawer closing properly. Essentially, when one uses the close button or attempts to close the drawer manually, it closes but then immediately reopens. I found a way around this until a service agent can come to fix it which is to hold it closed so it does not reopen. There is a little trick to it and it has to do with timing of when to hold it shut. I did warm up a biscuit in it and it worked beautifully, otherwise!
It does what I bought it to do: boil water and heat leftovers. As stated in other reviews, it heats VERY unevenly. Since I only plan on having this microwave for a year or a year and a half, I went into this purchase willing to put up with such an inconvenience.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good microwave, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a cheap microwave that will hold you over until you can buy something bigger and better, go ahead.
This Microwave is pretty good and very quite. I love the way it looks in the kitchen. However, that being said the reason I am not happy with this item completely is because of the way it was packaged when shipped. They don't box this item right and the corners are all exposed during shipping by the time I got it it was all warped and dented. Luckily it was on the side that you cant see when installed and nothing was damaged except for the optional vent part that came with it. Also, the install directions are very confusing...
The light on the clock does not stay lit when micro not in use.  When the door opens and shuts, the liquid in a cup or whatever may spill.  Also when reheating coffee from 7-11 it tips over!
I scraped and cleaned the area really we'll as per instructions, but found that the paint started to peel again after three weeks
The price can't be beat, and it has only the features I wanted.  However, it's noisy, and the door is difficult to open.  I practically have to punch the toggle or hold the unit with my left hand, while I push on the switch with my right.  I'm hoping this gets easier over time.
Bigger than previous Microwave - larger form factor, had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous Microwave.<br />Easy to use, works well, heats food evenly.
It works.  It does seem a bit cheaply made, but you aren't paying top dollar so you should expect that.  The door isn't real solid feeling, so far no problems though.  We mounted this over stove and the fan had low and high and now only has high.  Not sure what happened but it still works.  Be aware that if this microwave gets too hot (sitting over a self clean oven or cooking at high temps) the fan will kick on and won't shut off.  Fine, but we didn't know that at first and thought it was broken.  It's just trying to cool itself off!  Love the 30 second feature.  So many things just need short time to warm up or soften and so just pop it in, press the 30 sec and it goes.  Easy, fast.  Use that all the time.
when shutting, yet works well and seems to be a good value for the price. I guess I just miss the more sleek, less noisy one that broke after 9 years :-)
I like this microwave, EXCEPT the door is NOT always close right.. as you close it, it's almost as if it was installed a bit lower than it needs to be to close securely. The family is ALWAYS complaining about it:(  Also, for the size of this thing, I thought it would be a tiny bit taller INSIDE. Our freezer makes ice-cream VERY HARD so we 'nuke' it for maybe a minute to get it softer before serving- the round ice-cream container cannot fit upright in it.  Some cups do not fit either.<br /><br />The PLUS side of this tho, is that it DOES fit snugly into a corner! THAT is the only thing that sells it, in my opinion. I have NO IDEA WHY, it is so big & bulky for the size it actually IS, on the inside!? There is a solid 5&#34; of 'bulk' at the bottom, another 3&#34; at the top and about 6 & 3/4&#34; of height INSIDE.... and that does NOT include the plate & roller.... so you TRULY ONLY HAVE a microwave that is 5 & 3/4 INCHES tall inside!! ... The PLATE within, is an 11&#34; plate, but it is very close to the edge. ALSO, the bottom roller that holds the plate in place- is in TWO PARTS, rather than ONE. If this roller gets off the other piece... it makes a rattling noise & makes you think there is something very wrong with it.<br /><br />We only use a microwave for warming things, reheating pizza, a cup of coffee etc., and this does that job very well, however, for $150, I would have absolutely RETURNED IT- had I not lived on an island in Alaska, where the shipping would have KILLED  me :(
The four fixed screws on the unit does not line up with the existing hole of the microwave, so i had to zip tie it down.<br />they needed to be at the 12 and 6 o`clock position for me to bolt it down, but it works great.
Box was not crushed but top venting cover was dented and cracked.  I used the old one from the same model that needed to be replaced as to avoid all of the return BS.
SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 over one month after delivery AND STILL NOT USABLE!!!! GETTING UPSET.<br /><br /> THE RATING REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT WORKING YET !!!<br />So I can't be sure that it will.<br />The unit was delivered and it is what I wanted because it is exactly like the one I had for 14 years (newer model of course); but it has not been working as it should. I wonder if the tech will really getting it to work correctly. Waiting now for parts to fix the oven portion of the unit. The tech tells that the microwave portion only cooks on the sides and the center does not get the ray to cook the food, How can that be possible?? Anyway here I am one full month after purchasing the oven and can't use it. I still will be happy if they get it to work properly.<br />Love the fact that the color is not bisque --- thankfully it is almond like the previous one although the bottom of this one is white .... why??? Was it refurbished???? Original bottom damaged ???? Will never know.
The microwave was dented when removed from packaging. Since the dent was in the back and didn't interfere with installation, I didn't send it back.
We ordered this to replace the previous version. Style is slightly different. It does not seem as sturdy as the last one and it didn't last as long we would have expected a semi-premium appliance line to last. We use it as built in, which was fine for the first one, but this door is not conducive to built in configurations. The new black trim is okay. So far it works fine.
I loved this microwave's size and shape but in the last month (4/2016) I had two sparking incidents, luckily I was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly.  I just threw it out. Today I was looking online to see when I bought it (April 2013) and if anyone else had reported similar issues.   I see that there are similar reviews so don't think Ill buy another even tho I like the size and shape.   UPDATED 4/2016  it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap, this looks nice and works great, a keeper
My wife wanted a smaller microwave for the counter top.  This was perfect --- at least for 28 days.<br /><br />On the 28th day - all the controls appeared to work but the unit no longer heated.<br /><br />Amazon's return policy was to issue a refund - I wanted it fixed so I contacted Whirlpool directly.  They stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that I would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced.<br /><br />It's now one week later - no response from Whirlpool and I can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago.<br /><br />I decided to contact Amazon about the issue.  Amazon is sending me a return label and issuing a refund.  (I should have done THIS in the first place and never bothered with Whirlpool).<br /><br />I just ordered my SECOND unit from Amazon --- I'm hoping this one will last longer than 28 days.<br /><br />I would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed --- now only 3.  If the second one fails - I'll drop it to 1 or zero stars.<br /><br />I give Amazon 5 stars for service on this item.<br /><br />Joe
This Spacemaker microwave is 3/4&#34; deeper than in the specifications. This is the difference between fitting and not fitting in a 12&#34; deep cabinet.
This microwave is fine. It is not great. It takes three and a half minutes to warm up a cup of coffee, but since that is its only function on our counter it is doing its job, just slower than some of the more powerful ones. Its size is definitely a plus and fits in a wee corner. Its not having more programable numbers is annoying as one has to hold the button as the time counts up incrementally, but for a cup warmer it will do.
Fits perfectly in previous Sharp model space.  Heating seems the same as the previous model although this one states 850 watts and the old one said 1100 watts.  Exhaust does not work as well as the other model.  Fan seems to work same on low and high speed, no difference in sound or intensity of fan sound.  One would think the low would seem quieter.
Bought this model to replace the one bought thru Amazon 6 years ago. It just died abruptly, thought it was a fuse but if there was one couldn't locate it. Buying the same model made installation a snap. Just hope this one lasts longer
I have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great. I only use for re-heating or defrosting so it is fine for that. Some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it...so I use smaller plates for re-heating. I don't like the lack of number pad but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. It DOES have it's own popcorn button...:)
It is installed, it heats/cooks still after 4 days.  wife is disappointed in appearance, but it looks ok to me.
The push latch for the door is very tricky.  Sometimes it opens the door at once.  Mostly it takes repeated efforts.
This is the only microwave made that fits into my pre-constructed custom cabinet space. My first one lasted 8 years.  When it wouldn't turn off, I ordered a new one.  The first one sent to me would not turn on.  Seems like something was wrong with the key pad. GE's fault,not the distributor or Amazon.  Called Amazon and they credited me immediately and charged /sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly.  I just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent.
I needed a small microwave for my small kitchen and this one fits the bill. (Why aren't there more small appliances out there? Oh right, we live in the U.S., where bigger is supposedly better).<br /><br />Anyway, this microwave has performed fine so far (powerful enough for reheating leftovers in a timely manner). It doesn't heat very evenly, but in my experience, most microwaves don't. If it's soup, no problem, just stir. If it's a frozen burrito, the ends will be bubbling while the middle is still frozen. Annoying.<br /><br />However, the biggest complaint after having this microwave for just one month is that there is a thin layer of plastic over the control buttons and it is already scratched and peeling off in some places! Makes me concerned about the overall quality of this thing.
It is a very compact microwave and will fit well in a tight space.  The power is quite low and heat things very slowly, sometimes painfully slow. if you have a small kitchen, this will work OK, but be prepared to put up with slow heating and not so easy to use controls.
It is the right price but it is not the same size as it says.  We had the exact same one just a little older and this one was slightly smaller.  1/4 on all sides.
I purchased this microwave to match other Frigidaire appliances I have, with price in mind. I missed that you don't have the ability to turn off the turntable on this model--it seems like that should be standard anymore. If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation, the turntable function can be damaged. I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time. I'll get used to that, though. It gives three long beeps when the time is up, which is kind of annoying to me for some reason. Even when you open the door, the beeps continue. I haven't used it much yet. I tried the popcorn feature, and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for. I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button. But if I'd had more time (home construction--it arrived and was installed right away) and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return, I would have returned it and opted for a different model. It looks nice, and I'm sure it will be fine.
The microwave looks good, but stopped heating after 2 months.  I am on hold now with Sharp customer service. The space saving design is nice, but don't like waiting for the drawer to open/close. The controls being 4' off the ground are tempting for my 3yr old.
When we were remodeling our kitchen we decided to replace our Sharp countertop convection microwave with the over the range model. I really miss the old one. This new model seems to be a lot noisier than the old one. I went from 1.5 cubic feet down to 1.1 and it feels like I lost a lot more room than that. The hood light is VERY dim and the replacement bulbs (2) each cost at least $4 a piece if you can find them. Because we had to vent this into the kitchen we had to sent away to Sharp for a charcoal filter that cost $20 (filter plus shipping and handling.) We had planned to vent it to the outside but the vent didn't even come close to matching up the hole from our former range hood. The cooking turntable is white and very had to keep clean. It is only a month old and is very stained already.  <br />I do like to have the cooking area at eye level.  <br />I researched the price for comparable items on the web before buying and Amazon offered the best price as well as free shipping. I am very pleased with Amazon!
UPDATE: Yes i too had the door latch button melt and it does not function any longer it actually was replaced within the 1st year under warranty but now this has happened again a second time and i was only boiling water on the front burner, i see no use in paying for a second repair since i am currently using a pen to pop the door open i will of course have to replace the whole microwave in the near future & i will be soooo happy when i finally do i can't wait to ditch this appliance what a waste. next time I'm choosing a regular handle not a push button latch. Live & Learn   don't they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumer.....won't be buying anything from sharp company any time soon.   I purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model (emerson proffesional) stainless steel, I needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances.  I purchased it from Amazon for $275. lowest price I could find and am currently waiting on a $30.rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal.  It has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier.  My countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid $100. for it (on all sides) not just the front like this model  I installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability.  Exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates, unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low setting,wish it was quieter.The light has hi and low settings either is bright enough, more of a night light feature.  Overall it work fine and looks good. Not a high end unit but then again not a high end price.  It does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked, used it on potatoes which turned out great.At first I was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through UPS for fear it would arrive damaged but UPS did a fine job with handling.  Rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating.
