review_body
didn't use it long so i can't attest to that but for the price it is extremely good looking and feels like a quality build. just know it's small - you will not be nuking turkeys in this - and it's not super high wattage so it may take a bit longer. so if you must have your canned soup in 2-1/2 minutes and not 3 then this won't work.
really love this microwave. has the one touch settings that i wanted along with the +30 seconds button.  its a great size for a countertop.  it can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said.
neat little unit. i have no complaints.
excellent small microwave!  i recently moved to an apartment which did not have a built-in microwave, but also a kitchen that wasn't that big.  this microwave was perfect for it.  its footprint is small, however it packs a punch.  all my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly.  the only downside is that when opening or closing the door, the whole microwave sometimes may move as it's not the heaviest out there, but i'm not going to fault it for that, i just simply put my other hand on top of it while opening/closing.
love this microwave!  gives me more space in my kitchen. ..only con is the price.
had this for about a week and so far it's been great; the microwaving powder is quite strong; but the grill plate is too high for some bulkier food, that would be my only complain.
this is a funny story....years ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for $25.00!  it was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely small kitchen with very little counter space etc.  recently i moved to a older home, new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space. no room for an over the range microwave. my new little whirlpool cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen!  love it, love it, love it....however $25.00 would have been an easier price on the pocket book! lol
prompt delivery, my microwave is back up and running.
very attractive and useful mircorwave
although only .5 it holds a nice size dish.  i love that the controls are at the bottom. counter space is limited so this is peer.  would be great in a dorm room too
extremly satisfied
worked well on an old sharp carousel ii microwave. 1 can was enough for 2 coats. first make sure you sand down and prime any rust spots so they won't show through.
great purchase.  the microwave does the job and was a great price.
excellent results
works great, product was as describer and delivered promptly and on time.
perfect for semi truck at 750 watts can run on1000 watt inverter
works well with proper preparation.
good
what a great unit!  took some fiddling to install but the unit itself is really very nice.
i had found a small blue cube micro wave some years ago.  after 16 years of service it finally wore out.  i love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem.  i couldn't be happier.  it is the great same size, the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave. would not hesitate to purchase this again! totally worth the price.
love lg products. got product in a timely manner.
you can't use the &#34;cook&#34; feature with a timer going on the machine, but it heats quickly and is very easy to clean.
got it sooner thank you
lighter than the ge one it replaced.  easy, simple to use touchpad.  installation was easy and i am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances.  i usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right.  you just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place.
install was really easy, and the microwave looks and works great. the buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily.
just installed it  that part was easy
i couldn't enjoy our travels in our rv if i didn't have my sharp convection/microwave oven. i just love it !
excellent product -- does the job.  i have one in my home, and when an older over-the-stove unit failed in a rental, i immediately ordered another.  a few things are tricky in the install, but were easily and quickly resolved.  tenants happy, i'm happy.  in this case, the older unit had limited functionality, the whirlpool has several features new to them that are real benefits.
love it!
we really like the look of this microwave. we used the same model in our last home and liked it and just had a new home built and chose to have the same model installed in our new kitchen. we have never had any issues with it. it is classy looking, large enough for a casserole dish, and heats well.
awesome!
very good item
i was reluctant to get a microwave because of limited counter space that i have in my tiny apartment, so i talked myself out of not needing a microwave. but then i realize how convenient it is to have one and found this one that's just the right size, that's when i knew i had to get it. but don't let its size fool you...it can fit a full sized dinner plate. five star for sleek design and function. love it!
the microwave does what it's supposed to do and is easy to use. i like the express settings so when you press any single digit it automatically puts in that amount of minutes. it is great for urban kitchen needs. for smaller kitchens, doesn't take up too much space or for bringing up flights of stairs it is nice and light. really compact, heats up food well. great for the price.
what a beautiful micro.  i love it.  works great.
excellent! i love the shape and size, perfect for a small kitchen
had not heard of this brand. was a little unsure about purchasing.  really nice looking and very quiet!  great value!
very good
this is the best, most efficient little microwave we have ever had.
easily installed it is both attractive and operates easily
this is the perfect size for the space we have and i think it's the only one that will fit! and good quality.
i m happy with it
looks great. works great. i've been using it since may, probably daily, and haven't had any issues at all. it's stainless on the inside as well, so it wipes clean easily. food and beverages seem to heat evenly. great deal!
love the versatality of this oven!
we've been very happy with this.  not sure i liked the dial at first, but being able to dial in extra time is quick and efficient.
prompt delivery and great looking microwave. i cannot wait to try out grill function. i already went through instruction book to familiarize myself with the functionality.
great product
i only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when i bought my new house and it didn't have a microwave in the kitchen i was kind of like, meh, no biggie. however, after several weekends of cold coffee i caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space. i am so freaking happy with this. it's literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want. if you do &#34;cooking&#34; with a microwave, then this isn't your best option. but if you're looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you. have i mentioned how cute it is?!
it works just fine.
i needed a vertical microwave to fit a special spot in my galley.  this unit has proven to have both the power and interior space to meet all my needs.
excellent quality. fixed our $500 microwave. learned that mfg offer 10 year warranty.
i was a bit concerned after reading some of the ratings, but i took the plunge -- and i'm glad i did.  it does everything as good or better than advertised.  as with most products, the manual could stand some extra effort (simplification), so those who don't read it do so at their own peril.  both my wife and i are pleased with this product and hope it lasts as long as my original samsung (11 years).
good
this has been a great little addition. the plate is as large as a that of a larger microwave, but this fits in smaller space -- in this case, in a corner.
simple and basic microwave. works as expected and does the job. perfect for limited space on a countertop.
received product as described and expeditiously. a++++
super
love this microwave.  it fit perfectly in the area i wanted it to.  i wanted a simple, smaller microwave and this fit the bill.  most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me.  it is very attractive - i wanted some stainless to match my other appliances.  i have another danby product (dehumidifier) and find danby to be a good product.  in one review i read it said the microwave slid when opening the door - i haven't found this to be a problem at all.  the price for this is great.  would definitely recommend it.
so far so good! it's just big enough to fit my large ikea plates. i didn't think it would be, so i was pleasantly surprised. i didn't want to sacrifice counter space, and this was the best option. it seems to heat up pretty well. sometimes it takes a little longer than other microwaves, but for me an extra minute isn't a big deal. for the size and price, it's a fantastic buy.<br /><br />edit: just thought i'd update. it's been 2 years and it's still going strong. no issues whatsoever. it works just as well as when i purchased it.
excellent
works well.
we had the olver range model in our house but had leave it when we downsized into an apartment. this is the countertop model of the one we had to leave behind. as the wiseman said<br />i have a happy life when i have a happy wife.
great basic little microwave.  it is small, but it has all the basic functions you need.  it heats things very thoroughly and quickly.  surprised at how much hotter it is than my bigger ge.
could not have asked for anything better. the price was so cheap and the microwave works very well.<br /><br />the door is kind of hard to open. when i open it with one hand, i tend to push the machine a little.<br /><br />no issues with heating and seems to work well.<br /><br />the sound is kind of loud..but it is a microwave.
a little smaller than i anticipated, but still great!! i should've just read the dimensions better
works very well if you properly prepare your old microwave first by degreasing, sanding, cleaning and taping it off before applying multiple light coats.
matched its description, successfully replaced broken part on my samsung dishwasher. does the job needed, which was mostly just to keep the top dishwasher rack in highest position. i have used lever to raise and lower but it's just not some thing i need often. hard to install, had to really press on it using tools, before it made an audible snapping sound and settled into place. it only goes in one way, in a specific place, so pay attention because force is required and forceful install in wrong place will destroy it. since it is a hard plastic, i could see where the plastic mounting tabs showed stress from the install.  i worried they would break off during my efforts.  important to know that these are side-specific, you need to buy a right or a left to fit the need because it cannot switch between them.  when one breaks, the others carry the load and break sooner so buy spares. ensure your purchase specifies right, left, or both.
perfect space and size. i have no cabinet space and this works perfectly. but you can't put a regular size plate in it. still serves their purpose.
we love this. one of our favorite parts of the kitchen remodel. such a space-saver and it just is cool. i read some negative reviews - all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it? well duh. i have a 5yo and 8yo - they know not to stand on/in the microwave. and it's 2015 - who needs a revolving plate? i use a microwave for quick stuff, not rotisserie chicken and what-not. we are super-pleased with this microwave.
am very happy with  this
works the way i expected it to work.
i didn't measure well and this wonderful piece of equipment was much too large so i had to return it so sorry i'd have loved to keep it
great!
installed easily and looks great. it's only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints. fan is quiet.
good machine
great microwave.  simple and compact.
great value for the money
we opted for this style of microwave this time around in our new kitchen and have not been disappointed! the shipping was fast (thanks to amazon), the look of the microwave is wonderful and goes well with our other appliances (ge monogram & dcs), the drawer opens and closes well, it cooks wonderfully, it's quiet, controls are simple to use, the kitchen timer is handy...i know there were some negative posts, but as of now, after 4 months of use, i couldn't be happier!
fits ikea wall cabinets..
great little microwave!
really worked. the once rusty bottom inside of my microwave looks brand new.
came in on time. had no issues
prompt shipment, great quality. stylish microwave, perfect for limited counter space.
great item and seller!
5 star very happy with it
simply the best microwave we have ever owned
as described. a great little microwave for the price!
great product
powerful and beautiful microwave.
very good product for the price.
great product, looks nice... exactly what we were looking for. arrived in great shape two days after we ordered it!
he has worked perfectly right out the box. it was simple to set up and easy to use. i've used it to defrost meat, make beverages, bake potatoes etc etc and its been great. excellent value for money. it lived up to its consumer report's best buy status
absolutely fine.<br />actually, i recommended it to a friend.  it was the right size for her.<br />she ordered and received from you.  fits perfectly for her too.<br />i like the handle on the door.  makes it easier.
fits in my studio without taking up to much space. i have no down side to comment on this little microwave. it functions perfectly for what i need it for...which is heating bowls of isomalt for working hot sugar art. love it!
this is a great little microwave. it fits perfectly in my tiny space so that i have a little more needed counter space than i did with my larger microwave
perfect size for my dinner plates. i like the express cook buttons that allow me to hit one button to start cooking. cooking times for store bought frozen foods seems to be just right for this microwave. good quality for a low price.
works
i am in a wheelchair.  cannot stand to reach our over the stove microwave.  purchased this to place on he counter.  now i can microwave to my hearts content.  works great and priced right.  would recommend it to everyone.
exactly what i wanted.
looks great for the price and works well! could not ask for more.
product does the job it was sold to do.
love this! good size for countertops<br /><br />had it since january 2015 and loved every minute of it.
tthe kit works well. it took lots of work to unload and reload the microwave over the range though.
it's great
great stuff.  saved me from having to buy new oven.  it's been a year, and it's still good.
my over the range microwave died and the manufacturer no longer makes the model i have.  because it will take me some time to find what will look correct with what i now have, i needed a microwave oven quick!  took a chance, because i didn't want to spend a lot of money, and purchased the danby 0.7 cu. ft. countertop.  i couldn't be more pleased.  it works just great for what i need and it arrived in two days!
fast delivery, great microwave!
great small size, easy to clean. amazing price!
very nice little microwave and doesn't take up a ton of space on the counter.
great little unit. only big enough for one dinner plate, but does the job well.
the microwave and is nicer then i expected for the price. it is stainless steel inside and out. they also include a replacement key pad cover. the only thing i do not like is the glass turntable did not come with a wheeled undercarriage to allow for smoother rotation, but other then that very nice and i would by again.
this part was exactly what i needed to repair my microwave - easy install.
fits under my cabinet & is pretty quiet.  i've only used it to heat up things & works great.  takes up only a small amount of countertop.
great product, really like it, and the price was amazing.<br />i got in time and it was pack well.<br />i would recommend it to others, one caveat let's hope it last a few years.<br />martha
just the right size. not too big.....not too small.
good paint to touch up the interior of a microwave
part was received on time and works perfectly.
big enough for me, easy to use controls, great price
we are back up and running.
very , very good i event toast bread in it, thank you samsumg and amazon tooooo
it works fine.
exactly what we hoped for in every way.<br />after needing to retire our well-loved advantium, we opted to replace it with a more-basic microwave.<br />after rewiring from 220 (what the advantium required) to regular ol' 110, we bought this ge microwave-combo<br />and had it installed. what separates this unit from other combination models? well, for one...<br />we can use the timer and the microwave at the same time; something we kind of took for granted<br />in having had the advantium for so many years.no other microwave seems to have this stupidly-basic<br />feature, something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a top-rated sanyo unit.<br />(and they questioned us when we kvetched about the timer/use of microwave conflict, insisting we were<br />asking for too much; right...)<br />back to this ge: stainless steel interior is wickedly-easy to clean, the 'beep' tone isn't obnoxious, and the heating<br />element cooks evenly.<br />just perfect in all ways; can't say more about it.<br />thanks!
easy to install.looks great.
good microwave.
it has been about two months and my husband and i love this microwave. we have plans of putting it in our new island as a built in. it looks great and works really well. the convection feature is a huge bonus.  i would buy again.
i wanted a small microwave to heat food more than cook it in the first place. for example, i bake a large casserole in my oven, keep it in the fridge, then later heat meal-sized portions. this danby model is perfect for that. occasionally, i'll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch (or so) interior rotating cooking surface.<br /><br />one thing to be aware of, and that is this is a 700 watt microwave. most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves. this means you must cook things longer with 700 watts. no problem: do an internet search for &#34;microwave 700 watt conversion chart&#34; and you'll see plenty of charts you can print. i posted one i printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when i need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt danby. example: 4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package = 6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave.<br /><br />this is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power. it may no be for everyone. however, it meets my needs exactly. also, it looks and performs well. i have had no problems with it. i'm a satisfied customer.
took off rust under turntable with dremel motto,<br />then applied three coats ann hour apart<br />very happy
love the microwave. it works great and adds such style and flare to our kitchen.
fantastic, love this little bastard.  saves my counter space and looks great.
everything we wanted in a microwave.  all black looks better than just black face.  has the 30-second add-on feature which we both like.  slides around, but that can be remedied with non-slip material.  has a nice &#34;lip&#34; at bottom so can be clasped while pressing buttons or starting which prevents slipping in the first place.  great price for product--but time will tell for sure.
everything was perfect!
was drawn to this one after reading all of the positive reviews! they were spot on! i'm very happy with this purchase!!
worked great. looks like a new microwave.
nice product for the price.  delivered quickly.
awesome microwave, seems much expensive than i paid for it!
it fits perfectly under my cabinets - the measurements given by everyone are accurate! i was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment, but it runs with just a small dimming of lights. whew. it heats nicely and is quite spacious. the only annoying thing is that start/stop are the same button, but &#34;cancel&#34; is a tiny button near the top of the panel. so often i go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again. i am used to cancel/stop being the same button! i'll reprogram myself. in the meantime, i love it.<br /><br />side note: there is a cardboard-y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual - leave it there. if you go to the manufacturer's website, you can find out it's a mica panel to protect a vent. it's tempting to toss it because it looks out of place with the rest of the shiny chrome, but just leave it.
trim kit, bought along with the ge microwave is just fine. not large enough to fill the gap in the kitchen cabinets since it is replacing the large size ge advantium built in microwave. had to get cabinet installer to fill the gaps between the cabinetry and trim kit. looks fine. is perfect if the area you are using it in is the exact same size, so watch out for that.
big enough for a plate of food.  works great! doesn't take up the whole counter.
great price, 1000 watts works perfect
met my needs
good price for good product<br />the price was right and now after some three months of use, i've not had any problems with it
the paint did a great job. would buy again.
nice
so far, so good. i've been using it for about a month, it is a smaller size and less oppressive in my small kitchen. intuitive controls. no complaints.
very nice small microwave! small footprint but still powerful enough. also good for putting it on a higher place - like on top of the fridge - all the controls are at the bottom part.
great design.  compact and efficient.  easy to use.
love it! just as described, works great!
e z fix fit perfectly, worked great
fantastic microwave. i bought it to replace a pos ge micro that failed in less than a year. very powerful, very intelligent settings and very attractive.
works as advertised!!
my old microwave is going strong! planned obsolete is no longer going to take me over. paint works great. prep took a while as old paint may not like the new paint and bubble. so prep!
really nice fit and finish stainless interior wipes clean get it
perfect size. and it works great.<br />i love it..
this is exactly what i was looking for . not too large but will hold a dinner plate . heats food well. love the express cook feature, simply push  1,2 ect for however many minutes you want, it starts , runs till finished. also like the fact display goes back to clock time instead of saying end like my previous one. could not be happier .
it has the 3 things i cared about - a light that goes on when you open the door, a quick one touch feature (30 seconds) plus single minutes, and it is the right size and power for my uses.
works great for the price!!
innovative shape, perfect for limited coutnerspace in a small apartment
i like how it doesn't allow finger prints
love this microwave!  perfect size for our office counter, works very well and looks nice.
the buttons are hard to push, but otherwise, it's just what i wanted.
everything as expected. installed the magnetron and diode by following videos on youtube and everything is now working again.
perfect for a countertop.
good, cheap microwave!  i was able to tuck this into a cabinet which is great, since i do not like a lot of clutter on the counters.  no complaints!  works as expected.  for what it is... a 5/5 stars.
perfect fit. i went to several appliance stores locally telling me i couldn't get one to fit. love the look and bot microwave and convection  wok great.
great product at a good price and easy to install.
perfect for my needs (compactness, appearance and performance). a very high quality product.
compact, stylish and very efficient. wish it was all stainless steel.
this microwave is fantastic.  it fits into the corner of the countertop which i consider the dead space.  i am unable to reach most things placed in this space but the microwave is perfect.  i have more counter space.  i would rate the performance a 15 out of 10 because it's so great.
as advertised
good value for money. satisfied
fits into my cabinet space perfectly, glass rotating plate does not shift as my other microwave did. a good deal
very good works great
very nice and useful product
got it quickly & it works great
it is just the right size, it doesn't crowd the space!
i love this little microwave!  i previously owned a large panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, i was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  after coming across this one, i was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - what if it was actually too small? & #2 - it didn't have the crazy power of my last one & i'm impatient.  alas, i bit the bullet & have been very happy with it ever since!  i've realized that i never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night easy mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  i was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, i still don't feel like i am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  it was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  i usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever i want it to be & let it go.  i would highly recommend this microwave for anyone who has similar usage as i, as well as someone who wants to free up some room in a small kitchen.
arrived in well conditon, good quality product
it works
i love it however i had to return it and repair my old one as the door hinge did not allow for flush placement on left side, as its in a rv and thats the way rv mfg installed it
we love our new microwave! i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this machine. it works great, and was delivered speedily. thank you, danby, for an affordable microwave that really works well!
ii had the same problem that many people do with the ge caf&eacute; microwave. the paint was peeling off after a couple of years and ge would not stand behind their product so i bought this paint and masked off the interior's good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats. sprayed really nicely, covered well, not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long. dried quickly, minimum odor, nice sheen looks like new. this was a good fix although i think it's probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but i'm hoping that using this bought me a couple more years. the product came quickly and i was very happy. i would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it's advertised for it's perfect.
better than what's available at sears, works great, easy installation (i didn't like the black center as it doesn't match our kitchen, but for the price i'm living with it...)
this kit fixed my microwave and it arrived before the weekend.
excellent microwave and excellent convection oven combined in one compact unit.
works great not loud at all and small enough for my small kitchen. affordable price and shipping was fast.
worked perfectly. no issues and fast shipping.
i think it met and exceeded my expectation.you need atleast 2 to paint the entire microwave ( 2 layer).i am new to this ..but it delivered good results.thanks
we bought this unit for a remodeled high end kitchen.  i has been installed for approximately six months and we are extremely happy with our purchase. no issues whatsoever. i love the easy automatic open/close feature and not having to bend down to put items in the microwave. the unit holds much larger plates and platters than i was able to put in my former microwave, which is really nice. it also has many useful features such as a sensor that can tell how much an item needs to be heated to be ready. as this was part of a kitchen remodel i simply told the product number to our kitchen cabinet company and they made the cabinets such that it would fit in perfectly as a built in.  the item fits in well with our suite of other stainless steel appliances.  no complaints. i highly recommend.
fabulous oven, great price, so easy to use!  really glad i found this - have the 4.4 cu ft all refrigerator on it's way too!
works great! sorry for the delay; i just got my microwave working today (2-25-15). i was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem, but since the magnetron (in my oven) was 10 years old, i figured that might be the problem. however (after installing the new kit) my general electric (jem31wa  002) was still not functioning. so, i ordered new door switches (and after checking my old oven switches) i learned that the &#34;bottom&#34; (normally open) door switch was not functioning. so, i changed it out, and &#34;voila,&#34; my microwave is functioning perfectly! it took some time, but it is worth it! i don't regret changing out the magnetron and diode (as my old ones were probably on their way out, anyway! (i had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube. if they are still in working order, perhaps i can use them again, later! my most gracious thanks go out to martin microwave inc. and amazon; product works very well indeed!
the machine is attractive and is performing within the range of all advertised claims and meets expectations. the control logic is intuitive and practical.
love this microwave! i have limited space in my kitchen, it slides perfectly in the corner!
one of the best micro-waves i ever had
i love this microwave. i only require quick reheating or a baked potato every once in awhile. it's the perfect size!
love my new microwave.  it looks great and works great too.  love not having the microwave on the counter!
great service, very good for a small and compact microwave. very reasonable price
heats fast. reliable. amazing for the price!
delivery was on time the microwave look great more better then the picture and very good size very happy with this microwave
good product, stainless inside is easy to clean with rounded corners. designed well.
very simple to operate for my grandmother.
looks good, and seems to be holding up a couple of months later.
i gotta say... this microwave looks slick in my kitchen. nice led display... sleek metal samsung look... goes nice with my new samsung washer and dryer set ;) also works great and the controls are laid out intuitively!
decent size and good finishing. works great!
i had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed. a couple of coats of this paint saved the day. it has a use that is far more than cosmetic. it saved me about $175 because i did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because i did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly.
wow- my microwave looks like new! this paint is very high quality and covers very well. i needed only 1 coat but did 3 coats just to use up the can because if i ever need to paint this old thing again, its probably gonna be time for replacement.
excellent microwave!  we had very limited counter top space and didn't want to take up a lot of that precious space with a full-size microwave oven.  this product fit the bill perfectly.  it's been working great for several months now, no complaints at all!
i purchased this drawer microwave from amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home.  my wife couldn't understand why i wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn't think the whole &#34;drawer thing&#34; was a good idea.  she eventually (reluctantly) agreed because she didn't want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design.  once it was installed, she said she liked the looks of it (built into the island).  everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it's kind of unique.  when my wife used it the first time i don't think she wanted to admit i actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it's easy to get cookware in and out since it's waist high with the door open.  my adult son used the &#34;sensor reheat&#34; button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat.  the feature evidently &#34;senses&#34; the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it's ready.  pretty cool feature!  i love the microwave.  it adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great.  (i think my wife even smiled one time when she used it)
finally a microwave that doesn't beep!!!<br /><br />included &#34;crusty plate&#34; was badly bent.
it arrived in perfect shape and i just had to plug it in.  i have been using it every day even though i have an over the stove one too.  it is so handy to do small jobs along with the big one.
perfect fit in my tiny kitchen.  love the cool blue digital read-out!
i bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away. he says he's very happy with it and that's all i need to know
2 months & no problems!
works very well
over the range microwaves are a wonderful way to save counter space. this one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work, or back into the kitchen, and fit under my standard height cabinets very well. be advised that this requires a 20 amp gfi outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove. this isn't hard to work out, because chances are in a newer house, your existing vent hood has electrical for it's fan and light. watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine.
quality merchandise..  great value.
had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine. it's a microwave. you plug it in. fan speeds are great. first time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy.
perfect for my application
i've had this a relatively short time so my review is subject to update. the controls require a little reading to understand but other than that this is like something from the kitchen of the future. the automatic pop out / pop in is smooth and quiet. the power is sufficient to get the job done quickly and the microwaves are dispersed so there are no hot spots.
solved the problem, easy to remove and install, just like the video shows.
great item. works well.
great product- fast shipment
great suction not noisy
worked as advertised. like the other reviews preparation is the key. first i cleaned the microwave thoroughly.  next i taped off all the areas i did not want painted. i took the microwave outside and placed on a bench. i sanded down all the loose paint and rust with a sanding stone.  i sprayed several thin layers of paint waiting about 15 minutes between coats to let dry. i probably sprayed 20 coats. you could smell the new paint for a couple of days. it has been a couple of months and there has been no chipping.  good product.
great microwave. it is much more expensive than the typical small microwave but is worth it for something of better quality and at least some elegance of design. controls are simple and light to the touch. i don't miss having a numeric keypad.
great space saver.
we needed a new microwave and after reading the reviews bought this one. great microwave! easy to use. fits in the corner perfectly! great for thawing, reheating and light cooking.  really saves space. makes great popcorn too!
color matched great, easy repair.
works great!
great microwave for my home.
great
works perfectly
great piece of cooking equipment. all as dedscribed.
this thing is awesome. it looks just like a tv which cracks me up. it's a bit smaller than most microwaves in terms of counter-space, but also a bit taller. it has no number pad for entering a specific cook time; instead you just hit the start button multiple times to add 30 seconds. it is powerful and simple. no complaints.
perfect fit.
excellent product and service
good
beautiful!!!!!
works great
a good, small, functional, no-frills oven.
we decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen, so a bulky, over the range microwave was out. plus, we never use it to &#34;cook&#34; from scratch. why have such a giant wasting space? my dear, handy, wood worker husband built our new cabinets, so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave. love the drop down door. plus the features are incredible: slimfry, convection, and grill!! note: the samsung is not meant for under the counter, however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation, so it has not been a problem,
love this little microwave.  we recently sold our home and have had to live temporarily in a small one bedroom with very little counter space.  i found this one and based on reviews, decided to buy it and i am not disappointed.  works better than any microwave i have ever owned before!  very pleased with my purchase!
i've had this microwave for a couple of months and i have no problems with it, it is working very well.
great for the money
after several months of use i'm happy to report it's still running strong. it heats food evenly with cold areas and is large enough to fit just about everything i cook. the sleek design and color also look nice in my kitchen.
love it.
great unit!! we use it in our semi and it works wonderfully well. great size and shape for a compact area. i would definately recommend this unit .
easy install, no video or instructions required. if you can get out to see where it is, you can get to it and install it. unit is running fine with no issues.
i love this microwave. small is what i needed but, wow what great extra features and it is beautiful. i am beyond happy! yes it is small but, that is what i needed and what i am used to. i can't get my largest dinner plate in but, i can get my smaller ones in. i love how the back is rounded. i had a sharp half pint that finally died after 24 yrs. this has way more features than the sharp. i have very little counter space so, thank goodness i found this. yes, it is pricey but, well worth the money to me. update &#62;&#62;&#62;i  purchased it 12/20/14 and it died april 3rd/2015. whirlpool has been  very nice and will be sending a replacement.
really nice!
super cute. works great. because it's compact, some bowls and plates fit a little snug and the rotating plate has no off. otherwise, it's fantastic.
fantastic product. made microwave look brand new again.  has a strong odor for the first day.  dries quick and looks great.
i love this microwave. i needed something that could go in my new kitchen island and i did not want to spend a fortune for something that had mediocre ratings. this microwave has had mixed reviews but it is working great for our household. i would say the only somewhat negative is that the door is slightly slow to open, compared to a regular microwave door that opens manually. overall, i am very pleased with this purchase.
heats great, gets very hot ..
nice size for an apartment :)
works great no issues
great buy
perfect for apartments
very pleased.  we put the unit inside a cabinet with a sliding shelf.  one less thing exposed in the kitchen.
the 3rd one in almost 15 yrs.  a good reliable model.
what can you say about a microwave ?? it does the job looks nice , i am happy with it and the big plus it was delivered right to my door . no hunting around , carrying it in and out of auto .
seems to be good quality
replaced in sharp microwave; took about 30 minutes; now turntable works again.
awesome replacement. great quality with bells and whistles
put in my older 2001 ge spacemaker microwave oven. works perfect and same replacement number.
love the size and design!  i have had it for over 6 months and still working well with no issues.
love my little microwave oven!
great range and matched my whirlpool stove perfectly.  there was a little dent on the side, but it was not visible once it was installed.  great<br />buy and if needed in the future, i would purchase this item again.  works fabulously and is very nice and easy to use.
after two brand-new microwaves which became prematurely aged, paint peeling, dysfunctional i decided this must be a game that i had not grokked. when we looked for a microwave we did not look on the basis of price, being believers, you get what you pay for. this machine, and it is a machine made by man work flawslessly, and has a baked enamel, one piece interior which looks like it will outlast all the microwaves in my future. i will watch and report..two months and counting...
this is a very nice microwave.. very easy to use with a great size to accommodate just about any item you need to prepare. works fast and i would highly recommend it
small and simple to use. very well made.
although the add listed the unit as &#34;used&#34; it was in fact brand new and i am thrilled to my socks!!!!! it is installed in our motorhome and works like a charm! thank you,thank you,thank you!
sounds quietly after turning on for one second. it heats well too.
microwave works well and there have been no problems.
perfect for what i needed! i love this microwave.
exactly what we were looking for. it has been working great for several months now. it was perfect for our very limited space, a microwave box suspended below the cabinet and off the counter. it is quite a nice stainless steel look, complementing other appliances and black granite.
this is a great microwave!
shipping was fast and the packing was supreme. easy to install, we are doing a remodel and i had my points to use. so happy i used them on this microwave. my other appliance are whirlpool and it looks great with everything.
perfect size for my small kitchen.  very attractive.  easy to operate and performs well.
worked great.
this sharp drawer microwave is amazing!  it has buttons to both open and close the drawer for you.  we love the easy &#34;top loading&#34; system.  plus..........it looks great!  we highly recommend this item.
i thought i would wait to make sure everything was working correctly before i commented. the microwave is the perfect fit for my kitchen. it works exactly as expected and i was surprised a dinner plate fits too. it takes up a corner of my counter but it's very sharp looking.  i've had many compliments. i am a very satisfied customer.
it is a great microwave.  had to replace the one that came with the house (same model) since my boyfriend burned the inside of it.  it is quick, quiet and i love all the features about it.  easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriend...then he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen.
it perfect for a studio or smaller kitchen. it fits a standard 10.5 inch ikea dinner plate just fine with space to spare, but anything much larger would probably not fit.<br /><br />power wise its fine (it takes 2:30 to 3:00 minutes to bring a mug of water to boil) and heats up my leftovers just fine. clean design and stable carousel that rotates 360 degrees as it cooks. one reviewer complained about an unstable carousel, but i think they forgot to install the circular runner that provides support on the periphery of the carousel glass plate. the runner is taped to the inside packaging with the owners manual.
this turntable is exactly like the one that came with the microwave.  the original cracked because my son dropped it, so found this one on amazon and it works fine.
looks good, works well. does the microwave thing. venting is open at the top, though. things can fall in. that's a strange design.
what a great value!
no issues, i love the product!
part is same as picture
this microwave has a very elegant design.  the engineers were able to minimize its footprint by putting most of its electronics on the bottom instead of on the side.  i would prefer green leds instead of blue, but mostly i'm happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space.
love it so far!
excellent product. saved our microwave!
works greats.
great item !!!!
product has not default but the weight is way too much for the size of the microwave. easy to use. could the weight has something to do with the power of the engine? only the technicians will be able to say something about it. but will definitely recommend it to whoever is looking for good but affordable microwave. outstanding for the prize.
creates a perfect custom look.
we have been using this microwave for a few weeks and so far are happy with our purchase. it was easy to install, looks nice, and is doing a fine job of heating up our food.  we have no concerns at this time.
yup.  works well for a small rental unit.
very much enjoying this range! i used to have double wall ovens and a jenn air cooktop with grill/griddle. we've downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that i had with that setup.<br /><br />the small oven is perfect for 95% of the needs for my wife and i, but i do expect the large oven will get a work-out at thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner. the power boil is terrific, and the grill/griddle is very handy and easy to clean.<br /><br />i debated quite a bit between this and the pgb950sefss. the main differences:<br /><br />* this model has a porcelain top surface, the 950 is stainless<br />* the 950 has a double-ring, 19,000 btu boil burner - this has a single-ring 17,000 btu<br />* the 950 has dual broiler burners, this has one broiler<br />* the 950 has a ball-bearing roller rack (i believe just one of the three) where this has all standard slide racks<br />* $700 msrp price difference<br /><br />to be honest i prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically, but that's definitely a matter of opinion. the other features just didn't add up to $700 for me. i did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine, but i can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish. the power boil is excellent on this, i don't see 10% higher btu making a tremendous difference.<br /><br />i also considered these other five-burner double-oven ranges: frigidaire fggf304dlf, kitchenaid hgrs505xss, lg ldg3036st, and whirlpool wgg7550bs.  all have their benefits and drawbacks but the ge has the largest ovens and i got a good price through amazon.
working well. good size and good price . i like this.
worked perfectly!
looks good...works well
excellent product. i recommend it
delivered in 2 days, a day ahead than promised. good product, many features and easy to use.
works great
great microwave and very fancy, but it does get hot when you used it. i usually leave it open for a few minutes when i finished using it.
the item was fine. the price was great too compared other sellers.
i bought this for my brother and he said it is great.  great price point and it works really well.
very pleased with my purchase.
works great
the danby 1100w microwave oven has proven to be the right purchase for my apartment. the unit is fairly compact given it's power rating, and because i have limited counter space size does matter to me! in my opinion the danby is an excellent product (and made in america!).
very good
hard to beat for the price. bought this for a temporary living situation and couldn't ask for more for the price. as an older person the only improvement would be larger buttons for the start/stop but that would add cost. cooks fast and is an excellent choice.
great product for the money.
looked large in the box, but fits nicely over the range.  looks great and works great.  has met all expectations and for a lot less than other microwaves for more.
great price easy to use
impressive for the price,works great. quiet and powerful. opening the door is two handed sometimes but a good value.
everything is good so far. the price was low and i didn't know the brand. but took a chance. i have had no problmns.
a very nice product! i especially like the night light.
great!  seems to be holding up just fine.  i sanded and cleaned the area as directed and put on several coats, allowing the paint to dry in between coats. i finished it off with a light sanding using extra fine sand paper. the color is slightly off, but otherwise it looks and feels like new.  i also have plenty left should i need to touch.
it  works very  well. it's easy to use. it' runs quieter then our old one.  and  it heats and reheats everything we want. the only thing i notice is it's very  light weight. it tips easily, if you lean on it.
i have a small kitchen. this fit perfectly in a corner on the counter. it looks super cute and i have received several compliments.
it's small, and fits perfectly in a corner. microwaves things.
i just got it today, works great, just the right size, just the right price<br /><br />you could not get a better one for this price.
not very big, fit into my small kitchen just fine.
as described
this small microwave has worked well for my small kitchen. pretty basic features, but has worked fine.
we purchased and installed this over the range microwave as a replacement for a 25 year old one.  this is sharp is just perfect.  we required one with the recirculating feature because we have no way to vent it, and this type is not easy to find.
i just received this.  i was looking for the most compact microwave with the best reviews and this was it.  so far, i tried boiling a cup of water and fixed a baked potato.  it works just great.  yes, i would recommend this.
family is so busy with working and kids. when old microwave died right after moving and expecting a baby, money was very tight. my mom saw our needs and purchased this microwave as a surprise . this little thing is just right for our smaller kitchen..it reheat foods fast and works great . family is very pleased.
the person who designed this should have won a prize! makes the most of a small corner space and is more efficient; about 20% more efficient. great purchase!
great for work
i love this little microwave. it fits on my countertop easily and does not take up a lot of space. it is large enough to heat everything i use a microwave for.  the controls are intuitive and easy to use. the high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts i was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer.  the only minor annoyance i have after several days of use is that i have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven.  my cup measures 6&#34; tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in. however, i found if i remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns, it fits perfectly.
perfect
worked so much better than i expected.  two light coats and it looked like new.
this is just adorable; not quite the power of my old and huge microwave oven.  this one is sleek and small and very high-tech looking.  it tucks in under my kitchen countertop and in a corner, out of the way.  i have to nuke things a bit longer with this one, but that's okay.
great item, good price...great quality.
very nice
this stuff adheres well, dries quickly and leaves a washable surface.  i used it to replace bubbling paint on a microwave with a painted mild steel lined cavity.
this microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far!  we have a ge in-cabinet microwave/oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave i was really worried because to replace this unit it is over $1000 due to it being a specialty item.  so i sanded down the top of the microwave really well.  be sure to get all loose paint off - should be totally smooth.  then when the paint arrived i shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave.  it was actually a pretty good sized area i needed to cover.  after letting that coat dry for a couple hours i added a second coat and after a couple more hours i added a third coat.  i want to make sure it was coated good.  so far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great.  i showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now!  i let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn't have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use.  the smell is overwhelming and i would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face.  i would take a counter top unit outside to treat.  i didn't have that option so i had to just do it.
love the microvave,especially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigate.heats well-we're very satisfied with it.
i love this new little microwave- i had no room in my small kitchen, but i hardly know it's there, it takes up so little space. the only thing i don't like is, there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table- more parts to worry about should they ever get lost. the plate rests on one of the plastic parts (the turner with wheels) which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom- which makes smaller space to fit tall items. there is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />the whole unit is easy to clean- all, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. it has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee. the only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes- i don't know why the manufacturer would choose &#34;popcorn&#34; when coffee/tea is used much more often. this small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily. i am very happy with this product- so easy to use and clean.
same as it was described, best part, i did not have to go anywhere, it came to my house right  on rime
very well made and easy to install, great shipping on this bulky item.
excellent!  easy install. microwave works like new.
even though it's a ge magnetron, it solved my frigidaire model plmv168cc1 over- the-range microwave no-heating problem. saved us of having to buy a new microwave. happy outcome!!!
look around at microwaves and you will typically see they are all the same rectangular shape. if you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. that was the case in our place. we had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. that had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. not fun.<br /><br />our old one recently conked out so off i went in search of a small unit. i saw this one and had a eureka moment. since it is only about 14 inches wide, i thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. it does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />the only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. a magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />the other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. they should have built this with non-slip feet. i cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />the inside of this unit is very small. keep that in mind. it is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. you can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. i would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and i don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />these small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space.
works great
i was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews.  but the thing is beautiful!  my husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space.  the results were wonderful.  and now i have a built-in microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances.  the look is very nice.
very roomy compared with my last one. its very quiet and heats well. so far so good.
effiient spacious easy quiet fast doe what it supposed to do i purchased this for my office and am more than glad i did
this is a perfect kitchen microwave. i am thrilled with it. great price for the value you get. must say i am very satisfied.
i purchased this to repair my microwave and to save big bucks on a new one, it's been a while since i purchased it and it is still turning steady and strong great product
i love this microwave, it is cool, works great, and frees up the counter. it fit seamlessly into the required hole listed in the specs, and if you want a range hood and not a microwave over the stove, this is the only way to go
for the price you pay, you get what you pay for. it does the job, its a little on the small side, but that is what it is! happy with what i got, till i can afford a bigger one.
awesome product and delivery. microwave looks spanking new now. you cant find this product in stores lord only knows i hope i wont be diagnosed cancer in a couple of years as.  result.
prep surface carefully.  be sure to leave no residue on surface to be painted.  use multiple thin coats.  allow sufficient time between coats for it to dry.  the color matches my microwave very well.
it works well. does everything i bought it for. easy to set  and operate. does take a while to warm up for baking, but operating on 110v it is to be expected
perfectly fit in my kitchen, and power is ok. it has everything i need for a basic microwave. i've been using it for several days, haven't found any problem yet.
this may be more expensive than other microwaves, but trust me when i say it is totally worth it for the design and counter savings.
great product, have owned 4 sharp carousel microwaves over the past 30 years or so and they always stand out over other microwaves i have used at friends and families homes. the ease of use and guaranteed result is worth it every time. the microwave is stylish and easy to clean, the design has changed little in the 3 decades because it works and does not need changed. the size as well is perfect for cooking anything microwavable. having 1200 watts is a huge plus when cooking things like baked potatoes and frozen stuff that on a lesser powered microwave would take longer then posted times, but this oven will do the job in less time more often than not!  it is a stylish powerhouse!
i recommend this product because it works. rarely do you find a product that works as well as it says. read the instructions carefully and it will do the job.
works as advertised.  much cheaper than a service call or a completely new microwave.  just be sure you know how to confirm the problem so you know which part has failed (search youtube).  an oven that won't heat is often, but not always, a failed magnetron.
love it!!!!!  i am happy with my  purchase<br /> and look forward to my next deal.<br />keep the deals cinubg.  lol
arrived in two days instead of the week as reported, this was a great plus. it fit into the same spot as old sharp, another plus. the mounting brackets were in a different location & constructed less sturdy than the old ones. the medal was cheaply made & much thinner. overall i am happy with purchase.
this is the perfect microwave for my household. it is basically used for heating water and food. couldn't ask for anything better.
this microwave is perfect for a compact kitchen. i have more counter space that is now useable than i had before. it's small foot print is a blessing. it is large enough to accommodate my needs. the interior is spacious enough to reheat dinners or a slice of pizza. i like making popcorn in it. would recommend this to anyone who has a small kitchen and is need of a unit with a smaller foot print.
small package, but large inside. it will fit a full size plate. perfect counter microwave. takes up very little space in the corner. we love it. we have had many comments on how cool it looks from friends.
we got this as a backup when our large microwave broke.  it does a nice job and it's nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it.  the smaller size is really nice and doesn't take up a lot of space.
works great.. and really great size for cooking multiple items.  easy to use without a lot of fancy buttons. i recommend this to others. but be sure of the size as this is a very large over the stove microwave.
i love this. the cord is on the right, and short, i could have used the word on the left but other than that (because of my outlet location) it deserves a full 5 stars. it does reach to my outlet, but would have been nicer on the left for the location i have the microwave. other than that, i love this little microwave, i do have too cook things 30-60 seconds longer however, the space i save it worth the extra cooking time. heats up food, frozen vegetables, and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly. fits a full sized plate or paper plate, fits a 10&#34; bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top. this is not for cooking meals, small things only in my opinion and just what i needed and wanted.
it is perfect for my needs for space.  size is good and so far performance has been good the extra rack is a nice addition
exact device needed to solve my ge microwave problem. my wife is happy now ... so i can be happy too!
this was an excellent shopping experience.  i wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these. great shopping experience.
people always ask what the hell is that thing parked on the fridge, its the perfect size for me to warm up a single dish or a coffee! i dont cook in a microwave, its functional and its beautiful!
you can actually repair a sharp microwave that stops turning<br /><br />you'll be fooled at first because usually to fix some appliance, you remove the cover, or case, or housing, or whatever you call it --- the cabinet.  don't.  in fact, on a sharp microwave, they used some screws to hold on the cabinet that you don't have the wrench for.  it's like saying, &#34;these arent' the screws you're looking for.&#34;  (you don't need to see his identification papers,)<br /><br />the arcane baffling steps that aren't explained anywhere and that you haven't experienced before --<br />1. the little perforated plate near the center of the back, after you turn it upside down, is removed by ripping it away manfully.  never done that before on anything.  no screws,  just hack at it.  you'll be thinking, &#34;but if i bend it and twist it, how will it go back on? &#34;  well, first of all, you can dispense with it; but if you feel like it, you can flatten it and then turn it over and you'll see how it has little tabs on it to reinstall it.<br /><br />actually , once you get that little perforated plate off there, it's trivially simple.<br /><br />carry on.
i really love this microwave.  the design is modern and appealing and the function is ideal for application.  i am very satisfied with having this product on my kitchen countertop.
i use microwave just to rewarm my food. i barely use it to cook. the product is cheap and good for rewarming my food. i already used it for 2 months and have no problem. i don't know how long it is going to last. the product may also be good for cooking but i don't know since i don't cook with microwave.
we needed a small microwave to fit in our newly refurbished 1995 vw eurovan camper, and this one is perfect. it fits inside an existing cupboard. i had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use, but not when the door is opened. this one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it's in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen. some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn't seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism. despite this microwave being a different brand that the two we have at home, the turntable mechanism is the same, and it only fits together in one specific position. when it's properly aligned it pops into place and is very stable.
easy to use and doesn't take up alot of counter space. also sits higher so it is easy to clean. a little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food, not cooking a ham or turkey in it.
this brand was cheaper than some of the other major brands; however, this one was highly rated by consumer reports. got here in  2 days!
purchased from amazon and was received within 5 days (exceptional).  since it was the same model as my old one, installation was very easy with no new holes or brackets to install.  so far it works very well and i consider it, at this point, an exceptional purchase.
we have a ge oven/microwave combo (the microwave has the oven controls on it) and the paint was coming off the microwave.  i was concerned it was dangerous so i considered replacing the entire unit.  then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try.  my husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new.  couldn't be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit.
the appliance fits neatly my new kitchen perfectly, we hardly notice it is even there. the function works with all the setting of a regular machine, it just a lot smaller, the size a large dinner plate. i love it!
we were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room, but still large enough to make popcorn, and other things. this one fit the bill and it works great! we love it!
this is a good little unit. i wanted something of smaller dimensions so i could put it into my rv. it fit perfectly, and it works just fine. very attractive and very quiet. it's taken a while to get used to the new controls, but that's just because they're different, not bad. i plan to buy another for a small trailer that i have. in short i would recommend this to anybody.
with other microwaves, you lose not only it's own footprint in counter space, but also the clearance in front for the door to open.  with this one, the door opens 3 inches above the counter, plenty of room for other food prep. it tucks way back into the corner, previously wasted space.  it's heavy enough to stay put when pulling the door open, light enough to slide to the side for cleaning underneath.<br /><br />some reviewers criticized the controls, but hey, anytime you get a new appliance, it takes a while to get used to the buttons.  took me 2 rounds to decide the 30 second button was a great invention.<br /><br />my kids said &#34;whoa, what's that!!!&#34; the first time they saw it.  i think that's high praise in kidspeak.
this product was easy to use and when the paint dried - the paint blended in and match the original inside paint perfectly!
great item!!! it fits it perfectly. i really enjoyed getting this item. i definitely recommend anyone to purchase this item.
my turn table would not turn i ordered this part and put it in and the microwave is as good as new.
i had a ring of rust and metal on the bottom of my microwave oven.  my husband just wanted to buy a new oven but i had already ordered this product.  i worked great.  i followed direction i found online and my oven is like new again!
this was a replacement and the fit and quality was perfect.  i would recommend the product to anyone needing a replacement
it is listed as stainless steel, but a magnet stuck tight to it.  this is not typical of stainless-not this much attraction.  research through  google showed some stainless is magnetic.  i knew this, but the attraction seemed too strong.was this a stainless steel coating over iron-i do not know.<br /><br />the microwave has worked very well for me, i have no complaints.<br />caution: some cleaners can pit s.s. amonia should never be used on stainles!  if-if it was a s.s. coating and a pit goes to  to the iron!<br /><br />my experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside.  the coating starts to seperate  from the metal shell and fall into your food.  you remove it until it is almost all gone, leaving the exposed metal shell to rust.  this has happened to me several times.<br /><br />i am very pleased with the danby designer from amazon.
she who must be obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake.  a little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into her kitchen.  it feels good to go one up on this disposable society.
i bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn't a day that goes by that i regret it!<br /><br />this microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean. it is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back!
my wife does 90% of the cooking in our home and i asked her what she thought of our new ge cafe series csa1201rss 1.7 cu. ft. over-the-range advantium speed oven & microwave and she said, &#34;i love it. i may never use our regular (range) oven again&#34;. i use it for the usual things that most men use it for. popcorn, heating coffee, warming left overs and the like and for me, i think it is also great. it reheats just about anything i have tried to just the right temperature. if there are any cons with this appliance, i haven't run across them yet.
ordered because my turntable inexplicably shattered after 5 years. this replacement was listed for my model number. perfect fir. great price. no problems.
my microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave.  i didn't want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and i didn't want to have to remove the microwave to paint it.  so in a couple of hours, i cleaned the microwave (directions online), covered all surfaces from overspray, and used this paint.  now i have a new microwave and i keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used.  the rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won't rust again.  i am very happy.
i have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size.  shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts.  however, i have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave.  a few second for most things.  i don't actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks, etc.  for my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction.  if you need a smaller sized microwave, i highly recommend this one.
really enjoyed the drawer type microwave and the auto open feature is a plus.<br />comes with full warranty even though is is a refurbished model.
i was going to say despite its size, this is a wonderful microwave, but then i think the small size is the best part!  i bought it for my small kitchen, and it's not only adorable, it's a kick ass machine.  love it!
part is as described. arrived in a timely fashion. installation was easy. direct replacement for the magnetron in our 10 year old ge spacemaker. microwave is working again!
i was going to replace the microwave, checked it out and found it was the magnetron. ordered this, delivered fast, fixed it for under a 100 bucks!
i really thought our built-in microwave was going to have to be replaced, because of the paint pealing away and rust forming where exposed.  to my amazement this inexpensive product solved my problem with ease.  remember to have area well vented to the outside and to use a mask.  by using many light sprays you will prevent runs.
i've just had this microwave installed in my new kitchen. i wanted to find one that could go in my island and wouldn't  detract from my new cabinets. it's easy to use and is a great addition to my new kitchen.
this microwave oven was purchased for work.  everbody likes it.  never have any problems.  would purchase the same kind next time.
microwave that takes half of the space of the previous, fits in the corner and don't interfere with wi-fi!<br />putting the magnetron beneath the microwave made it compact.
we bought this for a new construction and haven't used it yet. it looks great and hope it works just as well.
it microwaves leftovers and it fits in the corner with a relatively small footprint.  that's all i ask from it.  wish it came with a low profile plug but i figured out a way to make it work.
this microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking.  it's full-plate size, fine for heat-ups and smaller casserole dishes.  best of all is the way it fits into a corner.  yes it takes up space, is not &#34;tiny&#34; but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space.  controls are easy to set.  haven't had a microwave in years, and somebody suggested this.  i'm happy with it.
this small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles.  it fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave.  it's easy to clean.  i'm so pleased with my decision.
this microwave is simple to use, and it works great.  at first i was a little apprehensive about the matt finish on it but once we got it installed, it looks great.  i love it!  my husband and i installed it...we only needed a basic drill, it took a couple of hours but we got it done.
love this microwave! it heats food & drink up fast. i love love love the compact size! counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves~so this definitely opens up some counter space. it's so cute too!
just needed for a touch up<br />but works great!  will keep<br />on hand if see another chip<br />to be fixed
my unit arrived quickly and in good order.  took just a little time for my wife and i to mount this on the wall; the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc.<br /><br />been working perfectly, can't think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top; small items could fall into this area.  i would agree with them, though in my case there's nothing above that would fall into it.
oh my gosh!!! this is fantastic!! it saved sooooo much counter space. we have a family of 3 and it suits us perfectly. i had one of the big stainless microwaves, just took up so much counter space.<br />only down side is you cannot type in a specific time for something to heat. you press the start button and it's automatic 30 seconds (press twice, 60...and so on) now that it's been a few weeks, i don't really miss the number bad. i'd rather save the space!!
we've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive ge microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! but what to get to replace it? looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />and then we found this whirlpool tv set, er, i mean microwave! whomever designed this deserves a nobel prize for peace, physics and common sense!! it looks just like a cute little old school tv set. imagine that! a cute microwave oven! but what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! how'd they do that??!!<br /><br />negatives? nothing terrible. yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! we use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute whirlpool tv/microwave thingee will do just fine. takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. that just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />and speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. major kudos to whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. steve jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. it's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />bottom line? outstanding microwave!
made my 2005 manufactured ge spacemaker xl1800 work like new (man! there are a lot of different shells for the xl1800 depending on the year it was made!)! there was a small round diode-like item attached with 2-screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement. simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick! i also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor...why not? it was there.<br /><br />the whole deal took 2 1/2 hours start to finish - including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor (thanks neighbor!) to get help removing and remounting the microwave. lots of videos on the web to help you along the way. be patient and keep track of your screws!
this is a great product  fixed my microwave like it was brand new  i would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave
this is a great microwave combination convection oven, the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that, but now my wife and i truly love it
we needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space. most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is. it takes up very little room, plus it fits easily into a corner. it has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate. it's tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare, but it is shorter than many standard microwaves. it has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine. we're older and actually really appreciate that simplicity. some things take longer to cook but not by much.<br />if you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly, this is not the microwave for you. on the other hand, if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy i definitely recommend this one. we love it!
we needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet. we struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby. this one is a perfect fit. i was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others, so far it has worked great for our needs. plus it looks great in the space.
we needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect.  nice looking machine and tucks into a corner.  would recommend to others.
chosen for it's size, this microwave is pretty perfect for us. we use it for simple warm ups and reheating. it works great.<br /><br />it is surprisingly very heavy. arrived very well packaged.<br /><br />i love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back.
this is an excellent microwave and very big.  i am so very pleased with this product.  i think it is the favorite of my grand kids in the kitchen!
we picked this microwave primarily for its dimensions (we needed one with a short height). we are very pleased with this model since it is easy to use, works well and is very quiet. it's not loaded with features but has been a pleasure use over the last few months that we've owned it.
after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; i came across this from whirlpool..it had great reviews so i tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is perfect!!
the unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years. although none of the holes lined up the sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop. so far the unit has performed as advertised.
i bought this microwave about two years ago, and it still looks and functions great!  have not had a single issue. :)
this is stuff. it really worked very well. it save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well. i highly recommend this product.
as all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. i can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. i now have so much more room on my counter.<br />the only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. the start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. i always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. worth getting used to for the extra space gained. plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less.
i researched many microwaves for our needs, and this is the perfect unit. it is my second one, as the first i had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store, it arrived damaged. this one arrived fine, well packaged for the trip. it cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous. it arrived when promised. i would definitely buy from this seller again.
yeayy i love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside !! it has popcorn button as well !!
during the kitchen remodel we decided to install a commercial type exhaust fan and eliminated the typical microwave location about the stove.  this thing is cool, push a button and the drawer opens, drop in your food, push another button and the drawer closes.
purchase was a good one.  love the design of the microwave, and so far it meets all my needs.  being short, the drawer is much more comfortable for me.  the process of ordering and receiving from amazon was simple, efficient and has been one of the best purchases i've made in the whole kitchen reno project. thanks amazon.
did the job. great coverage. made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new. very satisfied.  would purchase again
so far, so good.  i have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  if i start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), i'll post an update.  we use this appliance several times a day, everyday.
this kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year. since tubes are now made in far east, instead of by raytheon, quality as dropped, i now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it. it was nice to find a tube with diode (which has never failed) for such a great price.
this saved us from needing to buy a new microwave/ oven combo. easy to use.  we used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up.
very high quality product. this paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish.
i needed a small, compact microwave. this is perfect if you have limited counter space. the depth is good. it will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave. this is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side. the control buttons are simple but intuitive.
i ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days.<br />my turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave.<br />i'm very easy removed old engine and put new one.<br />quality product and parts was new.<br />highly recommended this seller.
love this little microwave! it is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and love that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. we don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so i can't speak to how it does for heavy use.
description<br />&#62; can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide x 12&#34; deep space.  not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; has the great simple operation of previous spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  that's all.<br />&#62; well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old spacemaker ii.<br />&#62; quieter than my old spacemaker ii--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; the turntable is a nice addition (my old spacemaker ii did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; has all of the controls and options of my old spacemaker ii:<br />...plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which i probably won't use because i like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  the &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds or add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...there is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />undercounter installation<br />&#62; the microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; the microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  if the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  however the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; if you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... the key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. you usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (that is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... the door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  if there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />undercounter installation kit<br />&#62; if this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need ge part #wx4-a019 [[asin:b001h815to ge part number wx4-a019 under cab mt]].  if you are replacing a spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do not need an installation kit.<br /><br />if you are replacing an old spacemaker ii (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; i purchased this profile spacemaker to replace a 23-year old spacemaker ii.  but neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; the spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker.<br />&#62; the lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker.<br />&#62; but the spacing between the front and rear holes is not the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;so, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old spacemaker ii, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this profile spacemaker.  draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; the screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but i decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />before you replace a dead microwave oven ...<br />&#62; my old spacemaker ii died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  i accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  i've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  if any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  for some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />reliability<br />if my experience with my old spacemaker ii is any indication, this profile spacemaker should be very reliable.  although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old spacemaker was still working when i &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  after 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />if your old spacemaker had a tray instead of a turntable, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; the tray will fit in your new profile spacemaker.  the tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; i use the glass tray when i'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  i often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---i use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; if you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />general hints on microwave cooking<br />it is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62;

fits perfect and works great never thought i would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look
the poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. this microwave has worked great for us. very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. i really like the one touch timer feature. it seems to be well built. ours has a sticker inside that says built april 2013. i am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.
this microwave works well and is efficient. it does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. would not hesitate to purchase again.
this little giant is great for small spaces. it is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves. i am very happy with purchase.
this kit is just what i needed.  my microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  i didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  i got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  now it works like new again.<br /><br />***there are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*
this met our requirements for a space saving microwave.  we would recommend it to any one with limited counter space.
when ordering cabinet for microwave i had no clue that sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly.  it looks so great and works beautifully.
we got it the same day our cabinets were being installed. we were worried about it not working since this was our first on-line purchase of such a high priced item. let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed fantastic!!!! it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens. we installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop. great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop. no more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out. this is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen.
bought this for a small kitchen, it fits nicely in the corner and works great. seems to be well-made. although it is lower wattage, i have not had to significantly increase the cooking time, and i can fit a plate or even cook/reheat in a round 2qt dish. the beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints.
the ceiling of my microwave was a disaster. paint was peeling all over it. this product did the trick. make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one.
bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my rv.  i had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me.  the unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well.<br /><br />great item at a great price.  enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks.
i have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5-6 weeks. i researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one. the availability and price here on amazon beat my local big box stores and chains. installation appeared easy for my contractors. there are options to allow venting outside, either behind or above the microwave (not so clear from product description) but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage (not compatible with local code).<br /><br />the bells and whistles are amazing, with our kids ready to show us how it works, right after we stop the clock blinking on our vcr.
had large amount of rust under rotating plate in ge microwave.  surface prep is important.  i started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust i had.  i ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  then sanded smooth.  wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. masked off area to be painted.  ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  i applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!
it is so nice! it works, is small, has a wonderful shape, it is an acquisition for my kitchen. i recommend it.
after following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven. i'm happy i had found this product. now i don't have to pay a costly repair bill.
i needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space.  this item fits the bill perfectly.  it fits neatly into a corner of my countertop, in no way dominates the area, and functions way beyond what i expected.  if you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it.  don't hesitate to purchase it.  highly recommended.
the microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides.  it's a very simple micowave that does it's core job well which is exactly what i wanted.  i didn't need all of the advanced features, cooking presets and auto-options that the more expensive microwaves come with.  i installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn't work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after...
i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top. i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed. the product worked great. the inside of my microwave looks brand new.
as advertised.  easy to replace, not really much more to say, bought a replacement part and it worked. saved the money for a new microwave.
great small size, looks good, fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace, and works very well.
have owned sharps in past.  this fit perfectly above stove. no alterations, no fuss , works great. looks great. would recomend
i love it!  i have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this little microwave is exactly what i needed.  it works as well as any other microwave i have owned.  very happy!
i receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen. we have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny, works great, and a spectacular space saver. highly recommended.
fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn't take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace
this was exactly the one i needed i wasn't sure i would be able to find the one i needed but i did and loved the fact i received it sooner than expected
fits in the corner under upper cabinets perfectly. only 750 watts, but just fine for reheating left overs, etc.  i like that the &#34;controls&#34; are under the door, so that the turntable sits a little higher.  also, something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave, as the door opens a few inches above the counter top.  i have only had the microwave for a month, but no problems at all.  i am very happy with my purchase.
we gave this to my daughter for her birthday.  her husband installed it over their range.  she loves the convenience of both another oven and the option of a microwave. the convection is large enough for a big baked chicken.
we were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged. it defrosts without cooking, won't burn popcorn, can soften butter without melting, and of course looks amazing. its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install.  if i had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages.  still worth it and would still recommend it.
i got this microwave yesterday and i've been smiling about it ever since. i just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. the only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? since the only con i can think of is the price, i'll just run through the pros as i see them.<br />1. it's unique. every other microwave i've ever seen (with the exception of the sharp half-pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. the bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) when you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. it's big inside. bigger than my old ge compact for round things, and i've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (i have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. it's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. good enough for me.<br />4. the led display is blue. very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. the interior light goes on when you open the door. some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. you can use the timer and cook simultaneously. pretty standard, but some don't. also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. and you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. no door release button. you just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. and it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. the reminder tone shuts off. yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (i swear my old microwave displayed end most of the time.)<br />9. limited features.the only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). i've never used anything more.<br />10. i'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, i'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. this gives it a kind of window-box look that i like a lot.<br />hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. you won't regret it!<br />note: the display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. i didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.
many more features than advertised. reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. it even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.
great little microwave. it's the perfect size. it's a little underpowered, so a add 30 secs to most cooking times.<br />small footprint and looks great in the kitchen.
i got this to save counterspace and the fact i only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn.  it performs these functions perfectly.  it may not have the most power but if another 30-60 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off, you have bigger problems than this microwave.
i needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top, and i couldn't find anything smaller than a 0.7 cu. ft. in any store.  since this one had so many good reviews, i decided to give it a try.  it not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter, but it is also the best microwave i've ever owned.  it fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size, and it heats up very quickly.  i would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen.
this little microwave fits into the corner.  we have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience.  if you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker, so keep that in mind when deciding.
this is perfect for one plate! it nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? this is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! i got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! she finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! my only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes.
this is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen. the domed shape works great on my smaller counter top. would recommend it!
love that it is off the counter, large, and works well.  i originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems.  an electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it, and without question, we bought the same one.
a similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non-adjustable shelve/frame above the counter top.  searched websites and found what i wanted.  then searched amazon and found one with the best price (@ abe's of maine)!  quick delivery and the packaging/crating was extraordinary.  would buy product again, and would buy from abe's of maine again!
i bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  this tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.  it heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it.  even if i eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, i'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well.
i needed a little oven that fit in the corner.  for size and convenience it works well.  i have found that i need to leave what ever i am cooking in the oven a little bit longer.  but it works well and no complaints about operation.
fits perfectly in our countertop corner.  fits in the &#34;dead space&#34; there.<br />it's on the small side, but it is perfect for our needs.
i have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave. i was looking for a space saver microwave, and i found it. it is large enough to handle anything my old microwave could do like day to day tasks of reheating, baking potatoes, and other small food items.
exactly what i wanted! it's the perfect fit. works just fine... bye bye bulky hand me down... i'm handing you down, lol
just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. just getting used to it. unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. i was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.i would recommend this item.
it met all my needs regarding space, looks like a tv, works well and you don't need a college degree to operate. very pleased with this products. little pricey but worth it.
i had a rust spot inside my microwave oven.  sanded it down, put on two coats of paint, fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back.
i like this microwave, it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen, but it is powerful. it is a good combination of quality and good design. expensive but worth it
looks great, works great. took less than an hour to install. was a little overwhelmed with instructions, but was easier to install than originally thought. looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen. i would recommend this product to anyone!
it's rather small on the outside, and just big enough on the inside.  everyone who comes over thinks it's a tv.
very good product quality, this is all i expected to get.<br />i recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.
from the moment i took it out of the box, it looked beautiful, fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great! i put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass. i did not want my old large white microwave oven taking up one entire wall. i don't use the microwave that much, so this is perfect.  it's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn and you want style and beauty - this is it!
i purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model ($200+) from williams-sonomo and this whirlpool is a much better machine. the build quality is excellent and the veritcal-ness of it saves space on the counter. had to return the williams-sonoma model.  the whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls.<br />at first, i missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad. however,, after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds. super product that i would buy again and it looks cool.
we love this microwave. it looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was. our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything (including our largest dinner plates). heating will require an additional 20-30 seconds but definitely worth the wait!!! can't say enough about how cool it looks!
i like the looks, the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel. we have multiple samsung products. all exceed our expectations of their products<br />there are no other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons
had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years - 2 ge and 3 samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house, vacation condo, and gf's house. bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5. hope to have the same luck with this one.
easy to install, user friendly instructions.  came in good condition.  manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  really good product.
love this microwave. product was easy to install, and easier to operate. the first one we ordered came damaged. the process to return item was a piece of cake. the second one came (from a different company) and was packaged much much better. we used to have our microwave sitting on the counter. we remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave. we will never go back to any other microwave. well worth the price..<br />love, love , love this product
this was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel.it is quite roomy. i particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features.
install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit. only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good.
this is the best microwave i have ever had.  love the size and the program buttons.are so nice.<br /><br />i use the bake potato button all the time.
thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find. but that was the only thing i could use in the cabinetry in our winnebago rv. it's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too. we like it's added features oer the older unit we had. it decided to only run on high.
as described by phil, it is very easy to install.  a tip, as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor, put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit.  after you install the new motor, flip the door you cut out over, and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up.  use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt, as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again.
i currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space i have.  bought this one again as a spare.  just in case... and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time.  very happy with this 800w model.  does my jobs.<br />  it is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house.  too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box.
the motor fit perfect, works great, price was excellent.<br />was much cheaper than new microwave a a a a plus
i bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that i bought the same one for my sister. i like it very much. its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. i recommend it very highly.
a very compact, beautiful and sleek microwave.  saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate.
fits a cup of coffee, dinner plate and popcorn. what else do you need? fits perfect in my cabinet out of site!
this product fit and worked as expected. for anyone wondering about how to install, there is a pattern of holes drilled in the bottom of the microwave around the turntable motor. to get to the motor, gently cut the metal between the holes to create a little door. open the door, remove 2 screws then the motor, unplug old motor, plug in new one, drop new motor into hole, put 2 screws back. you're probably supposed to throw the &#34;door&#34; away but i bent mine back in there. flip microwave over and plug it in, put turntable spindle back on and try it out. i recommend doing this out of sight of your spousal unit, and then take about 30 minutes to goof off. then return microwave to spousal unit telling them what an arduous task it was but how you figured it out and saved the family $100.00. should be good for at least a hug or a kiss or whatever...
this microwave works well. i wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders. it does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter. i am very pleased.
we love this new appliance.  just a few days before thanksgiving our old one died.  i purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches.  returned that one and went online and found this one at almost $100.00 less than what my local dealer could get it for me.  he agreed that i should order thru amazon and not only did i receive it in less than a week, it fit, looks great and works perfectly!
simple to use, spacious, and compact. :)  been looking for a microwave like this for a while.  the only drawback is it looks a bit like a old tv on the kitchen counter.
the microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable. i sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint. i did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well. there's a spot that looks like i didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re-do it. it's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month.
i live in a small house (400 sf) so i don't have much room for anything. this may be too soon for a review (as i just received the microwave y'day) but so far it's just perfect. i love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side, as my microwave cubby is only 16.5 inches wide. i like the style and the easy setup, as well. it's perfect for an apartment, dorm room, or office kitchen.<br /><br />one thing to note - on the inside left wall (if you're facing the microwave), there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent. there isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, i called whirlpool customer service to get some clarification. long story short - don't remove the panel, it's supposed to be there.<br /><br />other than that momentary confusion, i'm really happy with this product.
item was what was advertised, in condition advertised and delivered on time. that's all you can ask of a supplier. you must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint. takes a lot of sanding and preparing, but the result of spraying even coats is great.
i bought this microwave almost a year ago. love it. quality is good enough ( i do not use it too often). i really in love with the design.
this is a really nice little microwave!  just what i was looking for.  no complaints.  it was shipped quickly by the supplier, too.  the controls are simple and elegant, and the surfaces are easy to clean.  i would buy it again.
so far so good. replaced a samsung and the existing bracket worked. much quieter than the one replaced. my wife loves the<br />melt/soften function.
motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good.
this is the second sharp r-1405, over the range microwave i have owned. the first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service. so i was thrilled when i found the same model still being produced. i snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90% of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove. not only that..the price was about $200 or $300 less than comparable over the range microwaves. an excellent product that gets the job done!!...i highly recommend it!
for some strange reason, my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half.  i didn't have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an amazon vendor.  the order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again.  we are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product.
when the turntable on my sharp microwave stopped turning, i went on line to find a substitute.  some years ago i had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave.  simple device.  works by winding it up, much like an old fashioned alarm clock.<br /><br />after googling turntable, i came upon this little motor and thought &#34;why not?&#34;, i can do this.  i know nothing about electronics, so i realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix, i might destroy it, but it wasn't working anyway so i decided to gamble and order the part.<br /><br />i very carefully opened up the microwave (after disconnecting it from the power) and located the motor that turned the turntable.  it was simple (fairly intuitive) to remove and replace, and for a very small amount of money, i fixed the microwave.  i've had this microwave for seven plus years and now i expect to get another seven, very possibly more.<br /><br />overall...  one of my best buys on amazon.
very attractive and functional microwave, that was easy to install as a replacement for a ge microwave that no longer worked.
needed a new stainless steel microwave. works well, nice and big. it is only stainless on the front, black everywhere else. works well so far...
this is an excellent product. it has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. its not only nice looking, but consumer reports rates it as one of the best. the stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any kitchen decor.
this is the third model of this microwave i have bought.  since i do a lot of cooking with my microwave, i enjoy all the features this one has:  particularly, the &#34;baked potato&#34; and &#34;sensor reheat&#34; functions.  not only was i overjoyed to find the exact model, i saved over $70 on my replacement!  i was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order!
this whirlpool wmc2005yw 0.5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had. we sold our house, where we had a built-in micro, and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small haier. the only thing good about the haier was,  it was small, so when it blew out we had to go small again. i totally counted on the reviews for this micro and, thank you everybody, you are so right! i got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. the best part is that it really works well. we feared making popcorn, which the haier never, and i mean never, did well. always burnt no matter what we tried. this whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. we snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. it will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. there is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. we have never used the auto buttons. i would buy this again in a minute.
fits well on countertop in small space. works very well warming and re-heating. works better that other microwave that was much bigger.
everything is great!!! just a warning!!!! double check the template used for the upper cabinet. actually check it against the unit. in my case i replaced an older maytag, so i had two existing holes in my cabinet. then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up!!!!!! i superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up!!! so i did not make a mistake!!!! the template was off. no real big deal but now i have six holes.<br /><br />double check the holes!!! unit is great!! previous unit did not vent out of the house. this one i installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor. this microwave gives you three options,vent back,vent from the top or recirculate. i do not reccomend recirculating!!!! if you can vent this unit or any unit always vent!!!! i had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues, like wires that i had to reroute etc but i knew that when it was over i would be smiling and i am!!!! for the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the vent is the greatest!!!!!
my old microwave (dating back to the mid-90s) finally bit the dust.  i was worried that i wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it, but this one fits the bill.  it is small, but big enough for the needs of our 3-person household.  i find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves, and this one offers about the same height as a regular one.  it's not as powerful as some of the full-sized microwaves, but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint.  it's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive.  the rounded back works well for our needs, as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit.  after a few months of use, i'm quite pleased with this purchase.
i purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space.  since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn, this microwave is perfect.  i held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws.  i removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it.  once removed, there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate.  my old microwave didn't have an open space.  my concern was that if i heat soup, it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space.  it still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave.  oh well, this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times i used on my old microwave.  yes, i'd purchase this again but i'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door.
very happy with this purchase. for the money, great product.<br /><br />i was a little concerned, because some had mentioned the clunky door, but i find no problems with it.
i have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside. it works great and looks pretty cool.  i was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does!!! so, it works for all my needs. maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking i do anyway so it's fine for me.
we bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome.<br />the combination of an outside hood vent, range light, convection oven, and microwave made it a bargain as well.<br />the shipping was perfect. it was packed in 2 boxes, first the manufacture's styro lined box, then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box.<br />the stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great!<br />thanks sharp, thanks amazon
everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks.  this powerful machine is perfect for the typical manhattan kitchen.  if you are looking for a stylish, functional and space saving microwave - then buy this one!
i ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working. we wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee. we needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area. this was the only corner model microwave i could find anywhere online. it is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. the controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. this microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice. at only 750 watts, it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave.<br />although the price was  higher that a comprable-sized microwave, the size and shape make it worth the extra money.
i love this little microwave oven.  i just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners, so i wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog, was easy to open and easy to clean, and didn't have a lot of fancy options that i never use.  previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time, and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments (so there's a lot of pushing the + button), so i guess there's still room for improvement, but it does exactly what i want it to.  what i particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it.  very easy to wipe clean, no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry.
i love this microwave.  it is the perfect size for a small space, it looks nice, and it cooks well for a 750 watt.  the first one i received would not latch and whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one, even though i did not purchase it directly from them.
there is no brand name of the front of this appliance, which is nice because you can then pair it with your other appliances that may be a different brand. which in my case was whirlpool...just a note: whirpool and amana are one in the same.<br />i had it installed by a professional. i do not know if it was difficult to install. this is not a direct wire appliance, you will need an outlet in the cupboard above in order to plug it in.<br />so far no complaints. i have not had much time to use it...1 week since installation.
my wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it. i had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think i would be that impressed with this new model. i was wrong. this is one of the best appliances that i've ever purchased.
absolutely love it! takes up very little counter space - large inside, great height, would highly recommend. purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have. many compliments from guests; everyone wants to know where they can order one.
i don't find this microwave any noisier than others i've owned. i also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions. so far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful. great basic, affordable microwave.
replaced an existing otr microwave that had a burnt out magnetron. it's been several months since install, and i am still very happy.<br /><br />1) carousel works.<br />2) has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 1-9 minute intervals can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart.<br />3) nukes food up really quickly.<br />4) very easy to install. even with a old house, i used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame. took me two hours, and i was able to pop it in place all by myself.<br />5) vent does a good job at sucking.<br /><br />got it in fast, and in great condition. if you need a cheap replacement, this is it.
this is a great small microwave. it fits in a small area. replaces an existing. this works much better. do recommend
two days in and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. small foot print, excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate. it's also the quietest microwave i have ever owned. you can barely hear it. the lcd is super bright and the controls are so easy to use. i love how the entire front sure is flat - makes for really easy clean up. i would so buy this again and again.
we bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one, to fit into a space in our cabinets, and this was the closest. a bonus was the turntable, which my husband really likes.  it is larger inside than the old one, and more powerful, in the same space!  we have used it 4 months now with no issues at all.  the door does close and open rather hard, so we ease it closed, otherwise we love it! the controls are very easy to use.  we had a bit of trouble installing it, we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave  to slip onto the bracket, so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it, and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top.  a good choice if it becomes available again.
perfect replacement for my old one.  it is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme.  i can nuke larger items now.
this is the first 1,200 watt microwave i've ever owned. it took just a while to figure out i didn't need things to heat as long, but once i figured it out, it is the best microwave i've ever owned. the only drawback i have is i wish the completed beeper was louder. other than that, i am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave.
good quality product.  installed well and works great.  some reviewers commented on the way the door closes, but i have found it to be just fine.  hopefully it will last a long time.  i would recommend.  3/2013 update:  the microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year.  very pleased with it.  with lots of use and much by teenagers, it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far.  it also cooks very efficiently.  still happy and would still recommend.
this item works great, was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen. exactly what it says in the description, arrived on time. we have no complaints whatsoever with this item. i would definitely recommend it!
it works
wow, wow, wow! i was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. i was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. the price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. i had it install the same day and i am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. i know you will too.
the first time i used it, i was disappointed with it, but i don't know if it just got better, or if i pushed the wrong button the first time because it's been great since. nice and roomy interior, easy to install (i did it completely by myself, though i recommend you have a friend). i did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first, so i had to take it down to do that, but once you get the frame mounted on the wall, that part is easy. the hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above... i'm not sure how they could have made it any easier though, the problem is mostly a matter of physics.    i would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range.
i have had this microwave three years.  the only problem i ever have with it is that the door sticks sometimes.  i just have to tug on it every once in a while.  the oven works consistently and does everything it should.  the defrost stops intermittently to tell you to turn things over or separate them or whatever.  that is sometimes helpful and sometimes not -- if i have just one chicken breast in there to defrost i have to hit the button to resume defrost about three or four times.  i do respond by turning the chicken over one of those times.  i defintely recommend the microwave.
the ge profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  very satisfied with our purchase.
my daughter had a ge microwave/oven combo. the microwave had the infamous ge flaking paint interior problem. the cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. so i bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />to my amazement, it did! now it wasn't easy, i had to degrease the inside of the oven (tsp), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. i used paintstriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. then i had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />pro - followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! it worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. so about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />cons - the paint is acetone based so ventilation is a must .  pick a day when doors and windows can be open and i would get the kids out of the house. the paint does dry very fast in about an hour.
great product.  fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm.  sleek and effective!
this microwave is incredible!  very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great!  easy to use and to clean!
my sharp drawer microwave is so much more than i even hoped for.  it is convenient.  the button to open and button to close or easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself!  love that!  i had to reprogram myself to go easy to get it opening or closing, then let it finish all by itself.  i was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 1/2 second that i used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut.  it's good for me to slow down for 2 seconds!  there are more single cook options than i have used yet. i really like the push start once to get one minute cook time, 2 pushes for 2 minutes, etc.  can do the same to add a minute while cooking.  sensor reheat and sensor cook buttons are useful, but as in prior microwaves, i have to still keep a check on how it's cooking.  it seems to cook evenly, but i probably will get a windup turntable if i can still find one.    it holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare.  the 1000w power cooks fast.  love it!  love it!  love it!
after our old microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores.  i purchased consumer reports for microwaves and then searched for them on amazon to read the customer reviews.  the top ten rated had horrible customer reviews.  so then decided to search from the bottom of the list up, and this is when i found our next microwave.  loud was the only beef with this microwave.  now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave.  basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud.  but the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast, even heat with the turning tray is awesome!  this is used several times a day and after a month no complaints!
my husband & i were looking for a microwave for my daughter & her husband for a christmas gift.  this is the same brand that we have & are very happy w/ it.  this is exactly what we were looking for & so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price.  their home is nearing completion & they are so excited to install this microwave & start using it.  our daughter said that she just loves the modern look & knows that it'll look wonderful w/ all their other stainless steal appliances.
we've owner this product for several years now.  it looks nice and works great.  amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don't need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition.
we have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it!  well worth the price.  it is super convenient, you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven.  cooks evenly and quickly.  easy to use and clean. very attractive, a conversation piece as well.
after owning a previous sharp microwave/convection oven i bought this one.  installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed.  excellent even microwave and oven performance.  highly recommend this product.
excellent price and product (2 day shipping with amazon prime - another really good investment!). this has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a sears kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. it fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). i put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. really like the sensor cooking (so i don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). definitely recommend this oven.
this is awesome! love it! it was easy to install! cooking and defrosting is very well! and the shipping was early! very happy overall!
the microwave works beautifully.  the installation instructions left something to be desired, but we figured it out.
this black lg over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  it arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    we're happy customers!
this sharp microwave is great for a family. its large size is a big plus.  easy operation and nice finish and very powerful.   we had an lg oven before and it is a junk ! it lasted only 2 years.  our old microwave was a sharp also and its still working after 20+ years!  my rating a+++
this microwave is wonderful. the quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. if you read consumer reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. not so. this has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. for the installation/do-it-yourselfers: it's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. the directions are very good. note: if you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. the mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and i got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. i recommend this microwave highly!
this appliance works much better than my last sharp. as for noise complaint i didn't find it to much different than my old microwave. only bad part about stainless steel is that you see all the fingerprints everywhere. really liked the speedy service.
after too much research, i settled on this terrific microwave.  every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction-no help horror story. so in the end, if you chance having a microwave at all, this one seems better than most, if not all.  it works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. my experience with sharp carousels has been 5 stars.  at home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles. when i designed my kitchen twenty years ago, i made two below-counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave. i bought carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  they have been great workhorses.  the smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. last year i bought new stainless steel appliances (including bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so i chose the stainless steel sharp r-408ls carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-w with a 14 inch turntable from bj's ($99) as a replacement. the match with the other appliances was so good that i replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-w with sharp's r-520ks microwave as well. the display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  the carousels match the bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  my kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition. knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term, i can only say they are 5+ stars as week-old additions to my kitchen. the microwaves do everything i want powerfully and quickly. the cost, especially with amazon prime shipping, closed the deal.
for the price i don't think you can beat this sharp microwave.  i just wanted a basic microwave that did the job.  i was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and i was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the sharp would be inadequate.  my fears were groundless as the sharp functions every bit as fast the older one.  i like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle.  they recommend two people to mount this oven, however since i didn't have help available i was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought.  if i were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas, mainly in the venting info.  all-in-all a good buy.
you will be surprised at the amount and size of food this oven will accomodate.  it cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices.  i bought this because my other sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use.  i was used to the sharp features which made it the logical choice.  at the same time, i wanted to replace my conventional oven (also 11 yrs. old) because it never baked evenly.  with the sharp micro/convection combo, i no longer have to replace my conventional range oven - i'll use it for storage.
i bought the sharp r-520ks microwave to replace my old white westinghouse that stopped working after thanksgiving.  i did alot of research before i bought this one.  i was worried i wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  the good thing is that i could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  now i had an excuse to replace it.  i was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look i wanted.  i also needed a counter top model since i have no under cabinet space to put one.  this microwave works great!  i also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  it has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  i've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  there are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although i haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  the ones i have used so far work great!  my only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  it wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and i'm sure i'll get used to them soon.  the microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  i've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  all in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.  i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking, powerful, counter top microwave.
this was a great buy!! i read the other reviews and they are right on the money. easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great.
love it! love it! love it!  my sharp microwave of 10 years finally died.  it had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape.  we looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from.  this one was built with the same quality as my old one and i don't doubt it will last as long.
we really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from amazon.  it really has a good convection oven, although is somewhat noisy with the fan.  it was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions.  amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere.
this is a great microwave, especially with the $25 discount amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over $125. but let me tell you why this purchase was extra special. i was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered (size, weight, fragile, etc) rather than from a local store .  but the selection at local stores like best buy was so bad, i placed the order. unfortunately, the day it was supposedly delivered by ups, no microwave arrived. i called ups to see if i could start a tracer, but ups told me that amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package. i went to the customer service site, couldn't find a phone number, and used the e-mail system. i thought - great - that e-mail will disappear into the ether, i may never hear from anybody, and here i am without my microwave.  that was about 8pm local time when i sent the e-mail. <br /> <br />the next morning when i checked my e-mail, i got quite a surprise. an amazon rep wrote back, apologized my package had been lost, and re-ordered the item for me. before too long, i had an e-mail the item was already shipping via 2-day delivery, and sure enough, 2 days later i had the replacement package. wow! no hassle, no waiting, just great service. i couldn't believe it. i don't think i'll ever hesitate when i want to order something from amazon again. i don't work for amazon, they're not paying for this - i've actually never written a product review before. i was just so impressed with the customer service, i had to write. <br /> <br />the final chapter - the day before the replacement microwave arrived, the person who lives in the next cul-de-sac over from us, with the same house number, and with a street name similar to ours, showed up with the original microwave that ups had mistakenly delivered to them. i wrote amazon customer service an e-mail, and once again after a very quick response, i was able to arrange for ups to come pick up the extra package.  thanks amazon.  you're great.
i bought this on amazon to replace a sharp microwave, which has served me well for several years. based on the price, compared to other with similar features, this unit is the least expensive. i was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation. i am closer to being tim (the toolman) taylor than a professional at home improvements, so i followed the instructions with precision. the results were outstanding. not only does it look great where my old stove hood used to be, it passed my popcorn test, of which, i am particular. no scotching, full bag, satisfying and an extra plus, while i am beaming over my accomplishment, the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished, the display read enjoy. am i ever! i have in my digital locker,courtesy of amazon, my own .pdf manual. what a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit.<br /><br />solidly built, looks great, came with lightbulbs for range light installed! no cons, but could have used some help with installing, as the manual recommends 2 people install, but i did manage nicely by myself. i would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion, once preparations are complete. i have only owned this for a day, but, i wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive, if they are on the edge, to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket.<br /><br />panasonic wants like $300 for a comparable unit. i am pleased to pay 1/2 as much and get a quality unit such as this. you can even get this for $25 off before january 31st, free shipping (this dude is heavy!) and no tax, do the math, it is a steal!
