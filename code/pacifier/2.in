Great product... Took me anywhere between 30-40 mins to blow dry my clients hair with my old blow drier.... With this new one its cut the time in half... It's has lots of power... Great deal... N it's super cute...   Update: 7-8?months later it only blows cold air. I wouldn't recommend this drier for the price they are selling it now. It's rubbish
Bonnet is too small
The diffuser made my curly hair really frizzy and messy.
This product arrived in an open box. The cord was pushed into the box. Looked as if it had been returned. But it arrived quickly and it works. Small easy to travel with.
blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides
I only had the blow dryer for less than 3 months and the heating element went.
No warm setting! Can't use!
This was a great hair dryer....for 8 months.  Yesterday the heating element stopped working and now it only blows cool air.  I thought since it was a Revlon product and it wasn't cheap that it would last for years.  I was wrong :(
The wire mesh over the vacuum in the back wasn't even attached. I had to super glue it down so the blow dryer wouldn't suck hair into the back of it.
Worked great for about 6 months, then simply would no longer turn on.
Overall, I like using this dryer, but I have had to get it replaced twice in less than three years. I would not recommend it, as it is not a long-lasting product. My most recent one lasted ten months, and it didn't even get used daily.
It stopped working today after working wonderfully for a few months :(
Delivery was fast, within a week. The first time using it I noticed that on all 3 settings the air is just warm, doesn't get very hot, which I thought wasn't that big of a deal considering my hair is bleached and I shouldn't be putting a lot of heat on it anyway. The second time I used it the high setting just didn't work, I switched it from medium to high and it just turned off when on the high setting. I had already thrown out the packaging at this point so since it was only like $13 I didn't feel like it was really even worth it to try to return.
Everything about this hairdryer seems nice, except for the power. It is so weak. I do have thick hair but have another Conair that is much more powerful.<br />I would have returned this, but was able to swap with a friend who has thin hair.
I bought this in March and by July it stopped blowing hot air. It's such a shame because it was a really great hair dryer when it was working. I noticed other reviewers have said the same thing, which makes me think it's a flaw in the design.
The hair dryer is fine if you don't need to change the voltage, but I bought it for international traveling, and it's a big con for me that the switch doesn't turn to 250 volts. It looks as though it can easily turn with a coin. Do not be fooled. It's impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts. I stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing. I can barely see where the arrow is, which points to which voltage setting it's at. Luckily for me (sarcasm), mine is permanently at 125 volts. Maybe mine was faulty, but I was definitely not happy with this product. Would not recommend to a friend. Two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it's cheap.
The hair dryer had great power and dried my hair really fast; however, it caught fire in less than a month.  I had to send it back.
I have ordered this hair dryer less than a year ago and it is already broken.  The retractable cord stopped fully retracting after about 4 months. After 11 months, the high and medium settings quit working and only low is still operational. I expect a hair dryer to last more than a year.
Installation was difficult.  A small plastic piece cracked during installation, which caused us to have to install a different way.  I wish the hair dryer carrier was smaller.
The cap is very small and tight. I had to take it off after 10 mins.
I just signed in to find when I ordered this and it was last October. It has worked fine until it began having little sparks in last couple of days internally. Would not recommend this because of that hazard and only getting less than 1 year out of it.
The brush is way too soft. It doesn't make it through my hair, wet or dry. Had to send it back.
I don't know what all the fuss is about. However I'm not going to stand there with this thing stuck to my head to try to dry my hair. I found it so much easier and less fuzzier to apply product and let the hair dry on its own than to stand and let this dryer do its thing. A complete waste of money on my end.
had difficulty with switches due to reduced mobility of my hands. no problem with any other features
Like it but not too much
Just does not get hot enough
I like the way it folds up, but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle. The blower itself works fine, but I bought it for the retractable cord, which is more a pain than a gain.
Broken after 1 year
It was nice while the retractable cord worked, but that stopped working after 2 months. Now I have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won't pull out.
The hair dryer actually worked great for a few months but after using the cool button the other day it will not blow any warm air.
the first time I used it, I cut it on high and the motor popped.
I appreciated the low noise level and range of heat/speed settings.  Unfortunately, the product lasted less than a month with daily use by one person.
Did not meet expectations - returning for refund.  The motor is quiet but it takes a longer time to dry hair and then the hair is fly away  - not what I wanted at all.
My hairdryer fried out when I was on vacation after a few months.  I replaced it with a 30$ revlon hairdryer that has lasted four years. I wouldn't waste my money on this!
Edited January 2016:  After only six months, this dryer is wearing out.  It gets way too intensely hot, even on the medium setting, probably because the fan is barely blowing.  Hardly any difference at all between low and high fan, and it barely makes a breeze, so my hair is getting all heat and no movement. I went out and replaced it today.
I use the concentrator every time I dry my hair. It falls off at least 10 times. It gets really hot too so it's a pain to put back on constantly. The dryer is good. Just wish the attachments stayed in place.
Too loud! All the descriptions about the noise is true.<br />And the low setting is too low.
I would not purchase this product.This blower dryer arbitrarily cuts out during blow drying. It does come back on after a couple of minutes, but I've never had a blow dryer do that before.
I bought this to replace my aging Hot Tools dryer. The air flow is weak, it doesn't get very hot, and there aren't any vents near the nape of my neck, so the back of my hair is never dry. I would return it if I still had the box.
Tooooooo small than that I expected. Can grab in one hand. Really small
Same weight as my old big dryer.  Not lightweight!
I've had this hairdryer for 7 months, and today it died.
The cord is so short I have to stand at the plug
While the weight is decent. it's not designed well from a hand-use perspective. Also - no cool setting.  Hot air on low and high
Disappointed - thought it would work on my hair...but made my curly hair straight...with the diffuser!
Bought this in 2013.  Loved it, worked great.  All of a sudden stopped working.  Contacted seller and they said because it was 2 years ago, they wouldn't replace it.  Not sure I would spend the money again, considering it broke after 2 years.
NOT travel size. Works well but heavy and large.
Haven't used that often (because it's summer) but the few times that I did there was a burning smell coming from the dryer.  Would not recommend using for long period of time.  Better yet, find another hair dryer for better overall quality and purpose.  Good luck.
Was not very powerful, was expecting a little more from it.
Worked great until it broke 8.5 months in.
send it back did/t work
This hairdryer does not get very hot. On high heat it blows warm/cool on the low blow setting. Even on the high heat and high blow setting it is only warm.  It takes longer to dry my hair with this than my 10 year old Panteen hair dryer. No reduction in frizz. I bought this on amazon but I saw this exact hairdryer at dollar general for $15.  It is ok. I wouldn't buy it again.
Bad smell come out.
The brush is much to soft...doesn't really serve a purpose.
Terrible power!!!
Very heavy, didn't get hot enough to dry my hair.  Returned it.
I have had better conair products in the past.
Was advertised as red and came as salmon pink. Lasted roughly 2 years before the heating element went out. Also, fairly weak fan.
It certainly works okay, but !<br /><br />It's very big, it's quite heavy and you'll need to have a good memory to remember all of the functions.<br />I would say this one has been &#34;Over Engineered&#34; in the extreme and I'm sure as I will, many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit.<br />A speed, cool and perhaps two or three heat settings are I'm sure is what most of us need and want and I feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical.<br />Luckily, I purchased this on a very special Amazon Deal, but truthfully I will just keep this one as a spare.
Lasted only a few months before it died. Simply stopped working both the motor and the heating. During the time that it worked, average product. Not the best but not the worst.
I had a Remington dryer before this that lasted 5 years. I have thick, super long hair, so I needed something powerful that wouldn't leave my arms sore from an hour's worth of styling. My old hair dryer did the job in less than 15 minutes - it was miraculous.<br /><br />The new line stinks, period. Instead of staying consistently hot, it cycles through heat settings (including cold). The cord is also much shorter than before - a pain for tall women. The newest development with my dryer is sparks SHOOTING OUT from the dryer INTO my hair. Um, hello?! I've had this for 8 months, and I use it anywhere from 1-3 times a week for 20 minutes or less.<br /><br />Two stars because it is still fairly powerful, and drying time isn't insanely long. I want to love this dryer... I just wish the old version was still available.
Just received, neither of the accessories would fit on the dryer. I would not recommend this to anyone.
The heat did not last for long, just cold air blows.  The dryer is stylish and the attachment does not fall off.  It is sad the heat stopped within a week.
Dryer does not put out the heat as compared to the dryer it is replacing.  Blows strong but not hot enough.  The $20 Conair at Costco puts out more heat than this product.
I bought this because my older Conair caught on fire one morning, after about 6 years of use. I needed something quick and inexpensive. That is what this is. The diffuser is not well conceived, the directional is poorly done. The airflow is slow, and the dryer doesn't seem to get hot enough. This worked well enough in a pinch, but is not my recommended choice for everyday use.
It's ok but I was expecting it to have more power. Very expensive and same power as the previos model. I kept it because I don't have time to shop around, otherwise, it would had gone back.
It made my hair very puffy...very, very, way too puffy
well, it just didn't turn on after a year of use. it wasn't dropped or near to a water or anything that might've caused it to malfunction.<br /><br />As i was getting ready for my day, it just didn't turn on. i tried to troubleshoot it, reset, use a different plug etc. no luck.
Bonnet too tight!
This blow dryer seemed to be just what I wanted, but was a huge disappointment.  It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and & most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don't want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.
As a professional makeup artist and hair stylist I invest in a lot of products. This hair dryer is really not my favorite. I usually hold it by the base when I'm drying a client's hair but it gets so hot that I have to hold it by the handle, but when I do that I'm touching all the buttons and turning stuff on and off on accident. Also, the part that holds the filter on the back of the dryer keeps falling off that I had to tape it and now it looks terrible but it's the only thing that holds the piece on. Not to mention the metal grate on the back that holds the filter in keeps caving in constantly. I feel like these are not meant for travel, which is funny because it's travel size. Maybe I got a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Yes it's a powerful driver, but this seems more like it's aimed at a consumer than a professional which is sad because I had many professionals reccomend it to me. I wouldn't reccomend this to traveling stylists, but maybe it works better if you have your own station.
Has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit, but the trade-off is it is a bit noisy too.  Not mention in the listing, but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected.  Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.  About 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing, then quit.  We will see if they honor the warranty.
I did not like this blow dryer and returned it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />HEAVY & clunky<br />air does not get hot, just slightly warm<br />leaves hair looking brittle (not silky & smooth)<br />takes a long time to dry hair<br />&#34;rats&#34; hair as it dries (I've never had a blow dryer do this before- it's weird)<br /><br />Pros:<br />seems to have powerful airflow
I have long curly hair 3b. I bought this dyer thinking it would work wonders on my hair. First, I think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast. However, I would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak. My hair gets caught in the back and ends up with tge burning hair smell. Secondly, I bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it's already broken. Amazon is amazing and agreed to refund my money. I think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything.
I should have read through more of the reviews.  This is definitely NOT the hair dryer you want if you have arthritis. :-(  My husband has no issues and even he thinks it's too heavy.  It blows great.  No complaints there.  Just absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis.
This dryer made my hair frizzy and rough feeling, not what anyone wants from their blow dryer.  It also felt cheap and was loud, like those terrible blow dryers in hotel rooms.  This was a dud and returned.
Not as powerful on lower power
its super loud and kind of heavy. I dont really know if i like it. Dont recommend
I got this and was excited because of the reviews. It does dry my hair but takes longer than my drugstore dryer, but might be healthier. The attachments do NOT stay on making them almost useless. I tried to return it but my husband threw away the box, so I'm stuck. I can say it's pretty and I like the cool shot, but it does NOT lock as described....you have to hold it down the whole time. Also, the plug is too narrow. It keeps coming unplugged because it's too loose. It's easy to accidentally change settings or turn it off when in use because of button placement, but starting to get use to it.
In the beginning things were fine , I just started using it  2weeks ago even though I bought it months ago. With 2week(3 times a week) of use the thing has already died on me. This is not something, I would buy again. It didn't flat out die , it started declining in performance.
Pretty design, however I didn't notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with Ionic dryers.
Great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting.  I replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months.  Within about another 9 months the second dryer's retractable cord would not retract completely.  I followed the directions as to how to retract the cord.  The warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date so I am now out of luck as far as getting a new one.
dryer itself works good, however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down....its cracked, first day of use, I should send it back but I need the dryer now
No better than less expensive hair dryers I have owned.  Died after about 6 months.
just like another reviewer wrote - the bonnet's elastic is so tight that it hurt my head and I didn't have very large rollers on. I took her advice and took out the elastic and put in a long shoe lace which was a very time consuming and frustrating job but it worked. Plus I don't know how anyone could sit there with the setting on high. The medium setting is almost too hot. If I hadn't read the her review about replacing the elastic, I would of sent it back.
Good while it lasted.  I used it (at best) 5 times before it just stopped working.
Cord is way too short.  I can't hold it over my head when standing in my usual spot.  Also, it's not hot enough.  The hottest setting is more warm than hot.  It is lighter and quieter than most, but I still regret buying it.  I did not tried the attachments.  They went into the trash along with the box.
just okay.
Description stated this product was powerful and had the cool shot option. It does not have a cool shot option, and is far from powerful.
Pro: it has a very fast Cool cycle - something I've always wished for in other dryers. Cons: The controls are very difficult for me to work with the machine running - the placement is maybe made for a bigger hand, but I can't reach the cool button comfortably when I'm using my right hand. The diffusor is very hard to attach, and even harder to detach.  And this one is my fault - I just assumed that all dryers came with a concentrator, but this one doesn't. I tried attaching the concentrator  from my Revlon dryer that just stopped working, and it doesn't fit. (Shouldn't they be universal?) Unfortunately I threw out all the packaging after I checked to make sure it worked upon delivery. Otherwise I would return it.
worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.
I agree with the other comments- I love how compact it is but was very disappointed with how heavy it is. It arrived in the original package but looked used. The dryer was just thrown in there without additional packaging. It also has a strong burning smell when drying that maybe wears away with more use. Lastly, do not buy if you are a Lefty. Just holding it I was able to switch the settings while drying my hair:(
I have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before could get my hair dry
it has something wrong!! Graduated from spark fire
My old Remington ProAir Ceramic just died and I purchased this as what I had hoped would be a suitable replacement. Not even close. The airflow is too forceful. Even on low this dryer whips my long straight hair into a tangled mess. The nozzle is too narrow so it further concentrates the airflow. The dryer is on the heavy side for it's compact size..The high heat setting gets way too hot. Even low, once it heats up, seems excessive.<br /><br />It's going back.
lasted all of 10 minutes before failing.
Lasted less than 8 months
it is almost impossible to assemble but the dryer itself works well.
I've now owned 3 Andis dryers and none has lasted past 2 1/2 years.  This one lasted just about 15 months.  Nice product, poor ROI.
I liked this hair dryer well enough until sparks started shooting out where the cord is attached! I only use this dryer 3x a week and it didn't even last 8 MONTHS! That's ridiculous. I loved the length of the cord and that it had attachments. I smelled burning and sparks started shooting from my dryer, I throw it on the floor and quickly unplugged it. When I picked it up, the entire unit was very hot to the touch and the cord had completely severed one of the wires. That was not like that before I started. Is it too much to ask for a safe hair dryer?
Smell burning from the dryer
the switch to turn on and off is terrible
When it was fairly new the hair dryer switch refused to go the the high position.  Unfortunately, since I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a family member long before Christmas, I was not able to return it to Amazon so I had to pay almost the cost of the hair dryer in shipping fees to return it to the manufacturer.  I just received the warranty replacement unit.  The hair dryer performs great, but the switch failure was annoying.
It said nothing about ions in description.. One of the questions said not ionic but the box says IONIC. i sent it back as it was not what I wanted for my fine hair..
I bought this for my wife, who has long, brunette curly hair.  She blow dries her hair every morning with a diffuser.  I bought this to replace her current Conair dryer from Target which is on its way out.  Unfortunately, the diffuser with this blow dryer is very small (just under 4 inches in diameter).  She dried her hair once with the unit and said it had to go back due to the small diffuser and that it took too long to dry her hair.<br /><br />As for the positive, she said it was quieter than the Conair unit it was supposed to replace.
I wanted to like it, but the first time plugging it in and pressing the switch up, i heard a snap and the switch was no longer workin. Sent it back.<br /><br />Gave it two stars for the benefit of the doubt: Sometimes these things just happen. That, and the item despite being lemon, it felt like decent quality, especially for the price.<br /><br />Might try another one in the future, maybe there was a batch batch.
It is ok
Ive had this for over 6 months, and the cable retraction is not working as well because the cable is all twisted within the cable (if that makes sense). Still retracts, but nowhere as good as when it was first purchased.
Easy to install, just not what i thought. You would need to mount it right that head level, but i didnt like how much less control i had. I'll stick to taping my dryer to my counter.
This hairdryer is very heavy and difficult to hold with one hand. I didn't notice anything special about the way it dries my hair. Other, cheaper hairdryers work just as well or better.
It doesn't blow as hard as I wanted it to. But will do.
I've had it for 7 months and it's all but dead. Makes funny noises, smells like burning, changes strength. I've kept hairdryers for years and years before this one and have never had this problem. I feel like I'm going to be electrocuted!
My previous Remington dryer (which I loved) died after a few years, so it was time for a new one.  The good reviews seemed legit for this one & I have the matching Remington Pearl Straightener, so I went for it.  BACKROUND:  I have long, thick, wavy, blonde hair that I wash & straighten every 3 days or so.  PROS:  I like the looks of this dryer & it dries my hair.  Other than that, this dryer is horrible!  CONS:  It is the heaviest dryer I have ever owned, the buttons are so awkwardly placed that it is difficult to get a good grip w/out changing a setting, & it takes a long time to dry my hair (much longer than my last few dryers).<br /><br />Why did so many people rave about this?  I don't get it.  I would return this if I could, but I already demolished the box.  Booooo!
Too hard to handle
Makes a noise like its broke
I was disappointed once we got these together.  Although they are advertised as having adjustable wind speed, they do not.  There is simply nothing where the diagram says the wind speed button should be.  We ordered three of these and they are all this way.  Good looking dryer, but will not purchase again.
Sounds like it will burn out.
This dryer works just fine and could have gotten five stars, except for one awful design blunder. The switch to turn off the heat is momentary, and if you don't want heat, you have to keep your finger pressing it in the entire time. What kind of design is that?
We got this one on sale for $11 and it worked just fine from March till December, then it quit, no heat and no fan.<br />It was good when worked but due to short life span - 2 stars at best.
I read all of the reviews and decided to go ahead and buy this hairdryer in July 2013. It is a good, quiet hairdryer that I enjoyed for 16 months. However, just like the other reviews suggested, there is, indeed, a problem with this product as it has started to &#34;spit&#34; sparks as I'm drying my hair which is clearly dangerous. Although 16 months have passed I find it hard to believe the manufacturer wants a dangerous product out in the marketplace. According to the return policy, I am not able to get a refund or a new product so BUYER BEWARE! This product can be dangerous and their policy doesn't seem to address this situation. Amazon, please consider what you might do to help this situation given the product is spitting sparks within inches of your customers' faces. Perhaps you should discontinue selling it...
Kind of small
Splurge just a little and get the Babyliss Pro BAB2000.  The Conair felt cheap.  While the Babyliss feels much better in the hand.  The Babyliss will give a deeper heat as compared to the Conair, not necessarily hotter but a better and even distribution of heat.  I returned the Conair.
Hair dryer was fair, attachment falls off when drying.
I've had this dryer for a little less than a year and a half and it just burnt out and stopped working a week ago.  I was drying my hair and heard the dryer suddenly get quieter. Then I smelled burning... And it just died. I'm a little disappointed with this as I had an older model that thankfully, I kept as a spare for travel. The older model of this dryer is still working 10 years later, sans a missing temp button that fell off just before I purchased this newer one.
STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 7 MONTHS :(
Very noisy!!! Not comfortable to sit under. Was trying to replace one the was 30 to 40 years old. We all know they dont make things like they use to.
I bought this hooded dryer because I do roller sets & deep conditioning treatments weekly.  At at first, I was really happy with my purchase; the dryer is quiet, and dries my hair quickly.  However, less than 6 months later, the Timer Knob breaks!  I tried super glue, to mend the knob, but that didn't work so this dryer is USELESS now.  I cannot set the time/turn it on, without that knob so I can't use the dryer.  I'm extremely disappointed in the quality item and I basically feel like I threw $100 + in the trash.<br /><br />I can't remember if this dryer came with a warranty, but if I could give the Timer knob replaced I would rate this product higher; for now it's non-functional.
Unlike another Conair I bought from Amazon years ago, this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic. To add insult to injury, the purple plastic of the iron is not the slick metallic looking plastic from the packaging, but rather a gaudy-looking pageant queen light purple.
The bristles on the brush attachment are too soft to pull my hair strongly enough so that it straightens nicely. Also, the drier can't handle the highest strength heat setting.
Way too loud and large for travel. Returned it as soon as it arrived.
This hair dryer only lasted a couple of months before it died on me. Pretty disappointed it didn't last very long because it was a great blow dryer when it worked.
broke very quickly
Not adjustable. My neck hurts.
It's not as hot as previous dryers I've owned. It's held up for over a year, so I'm not going to pan it altogether, but I wouldn't recommend or buy it again.
Pros:  -- Price    Cons:  -- Build quality, way bigger size and noise
Very quick delivery, product is not as good as I expected. Not very powerful, although it does dry hair fast. I figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair. Wouldn't purchase again :(
Product just decided to stop working after a few years. Never dropped it and kept it in good condition. I'm guessing maybe the thing overheated?
I really wanted to like this (especially when it arrived super fast -- within 24 hours of ordering).  Sadly, the cord was short, and it was difficult to hold and use without accidentally switching the buttons.  It left my hair feeling like straw.  Time to try another!
This would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely.
Small and convenient, however heat seems low and hairdryer is rather loud.
Excellent product for such a great price. Hearts well, folds even better! Impressed.   UPDATE...   After using it maybe once a month (4-5 times since purchase) the retractable cord no longer works. Very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product. Still works decently well but that sucks!
I got a pro-versa instead of jerdon,amazon says pro-versa makes jerdon,no speeds or heat settings,just on and off button,unfortunately its already  on wall,did not notice til after,heck of a time putting it up also, very difficult,will not buy again
When it works, it a lightweight and powerful hair dryer. However, it started to make weird noises and squeaky sounds after 1 year and three months. Other hair dryers I used usually last more than 2.5 years!
Not happy at the quality of hair dryer for the price I paid 28. Better version at Costco for 20. I had a previous conair hair dryer that lasted 10 yrs and was very happy with it. This one had cheap plastic on/off button and just low/high speed blower.
Not powerful enough and not a good value for the mney.
I was replacing this unit with another Sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years. When this arrived first the hi-low setting didn’t work. Also it isn’t hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall. That was my fault I didn’t realize it when I ordered it. So I returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle. A happy wife is a happy LIFE.
On high heat dryer blows hair so hard you cannot style the hair, it just frizzes. On medium heat the dryer doesn't get hot enough when styling. It takes forever to dry on medium. In my opinion this unit is best as a blow &#34;dryer&#34;, not a styler.
Dryer itself works fine, but The on off and temperature switches are poorly designed and hard to use.  If my hands are wet or have hair products on them I can't adjust them at all.
It was a nice hair dryer, came highly recommended by several sites. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 10 uses before the power began to surge and there was a distinct ozone odor coming from it. For safety I shut it off immediately. I don't use a hair dryer that often, so I had already had it past the time I could return it. I don't know if mine was a dud or not or if it perhaps was damaged some way in shipping, but I hesitate to buy the same model. It was to replace a dryer that had lasted me over 10 years, so I am very disappointed.
this dryer did not blow with much power, I returned it.
The adapter with the spikes was horrible.  It was very hard and hurt my head. I am returning it.
I have a mini pro and thought the one I ordered was similar. It was bulkier to use and heavier. I returned it. The &#34;Mini Pro&#34; is what I hope to purchase as my current blow dryer, still working well, will need to be replaced in the near future.
Great dryer when it worked.  I purchased this hair dryer in January 2014.  Only used it twice a week on the low heat setting up until now.  Yesterday while using the dryer on the low setting the motor speed suddenly became very low and the thermal switch inside kicked the heating element off.  This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I've purchased.  The first one lasted six years.
Within nine months of purchase this hair dryer stopped working - overheats within minutes.  I don't even dry my hair but a few times a month so this is not the best purchase.
Easy mounting but very little power. I recommend you get one that has 1800 or more watts.
Have had this less than a year and it's started to take much longer to dry my hair- the air isn't coming out as hot or a fast as it used to. And most recently it started throwing out green sparks. I'm getting a new one but won't be purchasing this again.
I bought this blow dryer in mid of May 2014 and it stopped working in mid of October 2014! Would never buy it again!
This hairdryer doesn't have enough oomph to get the job done.  It needs more power to blow air.  It is frustrating to dry my hair with it.
I liked this product but it didn't last very long.
This blow dryer was more annoying that useful.  I purchased this an an emergency dryer and mine gave up on me. What a disappoinment. The buttons kept swiching on there own from hot to cold to warm from medium to high heat. Just because the buttons are accidentally touched doesn't mean it should switch that easy. That alone did it for me. Also my hair frizzed up almost immediately after drying my hair. On the other hand my mom used it and although she also complained about the buttons switching easily,  her hair didn't frizz up my mine did. It stayed smooth.
The bad reviews of this product were pretty accurate but I didn't want to spend a lot on a new hair dryer.  The attachments don't stay on, and the sliding controls for power and heat are so difficult to move I have to use a towel to get enough traction to turn my hair dryer on.  The 'high' temperature is extremely hot, which dries my hair very quickly, but I'm not convinced it helps my hair look healthy, as my ends have started to look like straw since I started using this hair dryer. I wish I had invested in a better hair dryer!
I gave it a 2 just because it didn't fit in my blower.
I'm only giving this dryer 2 stars because when it works, it is the best dryer.  I like it because it generates good heat without the blow part being a hurricane, which allows for good control for drying and styling and I get compliments on my hair and how shiny it is.  The huge disappointment in this dryer is that this is my second one, and in a year it broke the one before that same deal, lasted just under 2 years.  A $150 dryer should last longer than that.  I cleaned the filter as recommended, if it requires more than what i was doing then i guess the dryer is just too high maintenance for me.  I just contacted the vendor i bought it through and i'm hoping the manufacturer is going to replace it, otherwise i'm done using these dryers.
Didnt last long maybe a month. Made a weird noise. And knocked the electric out, guess i brought a bad one!!!
The dryer is the worst one I ever had it started falling apart on the first day of using it, don't loose your money on junk.
It was great while it lasted - 5 months! Just stopped working.
cord is to stiff, hard but it is fine for the price . The dryer works good.
I too bought this hair dryer in November 2013 wanting something that would last longer but it quit working two weeks ago. Love the hairdryer but I don't think it's worth the money if it doesn't last.
Not suitable for home use.  Too heavy and switches are small.  Though it is durable.
Drayer failed in low drying position after à weekend of normal use ! Whatever do i do. Next? Thanks
This blow dryer was amazing- for about 5 months. Then it died. I'm a stylist so it was very lightweight, which is important, and it got through the toughest hair. Until the day it died. I have gone back to using my twin turbo- which is heavier, but the lifespan is way better.
This is just like the one I have. According to the discription in the ad by Amazon, it was suppose to be light weight. But I was disappointed when it arrived, because it weighed more it was discribed.
Too Loud!!!!!!! Like an airplane taking off!
Can't tell you how much loved this dryer...for 2 weeks. The first one I bought burnt out on me in less than a week..shipped it back and gave it another try. I've not had my replacement one for 5 weeks and now the cool button is stuck. Sending this one back too..don't buy!!!!
Having purchased a similar product some years ago, that I was happy with, I re-ordered this product. It is an updated version of my earlier order. What a difference. This dryer is very noisy and I would not recommend it. I was disappointed and returned the product.
It looks like it wasn't original
This was my first small dyer! It was uncomfortable to hold, but the main reason I didn't like it was because it wasn't hot enough. It also made my hair look flat and limp.
UPDATED Sept 2015:<br />This dryer died today after almost catching on fire.  I sniffed a burning smell and 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died. I only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time. Always cleaned lint out of the air vent. Very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use. Does anyone make a quality product??<br /><br />his is a terrific dryer for the price here on Amazon.  It seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud. It has three heat settings and two power settings.  I love it.  Great for blow drying my two dogs on a cooler setting.
when I flipped to 220 I could no longer turn the hair dryer to high. and now can't flip back to 110.
It melted into a pool of plastic in just a couple months.  Forget it.  This is junk
A bit noisy.did not like this item.
every time i switch setting or hit cool button the lights dim & that scares me.
Retractable cord broke in 2 weeks, I would not recommend this product.
This one replaced one exactly like it which the handle would no longer lock in place.  The new one has an issue that you have to fight the cord to get it to retract.  The dryer part of both work fine.  The bells and whistles neither chime or whistle.
Always like Conair brand but this one is very annoying because it powers itself down to the lower speed for a few seconds every minute or so as you are using it.  It does this for about 15 seconds and then goes back to high.  This may be a defect because as I said I have never had a Conair that did this but wow it is sure frustrating.
Worked well, died after a year of use.
On the mid speed it wasn't hot enough.  I returned it.
Not the best dryer for fine hair.  Will return it.
The 5 star reviews are a bit of a stretch. I've had a Vidal Sassoon dryer for almost 15 years now and I thought maybe I should step into the 21st century. Honestly this tourmaline stuff didn't make a difference in my hair. My hair is usually very shiny but this dryer dulled it for some reason. I do like the gripy texture and the color scheme is cute, it's much darker in person.  It would've been better as a grey color.  I'll probably air dry my hair mostly and finish up the rest of the moisture with this.  The worst part about this dryer really is the switch. I mean they seriously couldn't see this design flaw and couldn't make it more basic and sturdy? The switch shakes around and feels like it's about to break off. Anyway, I was going to return it but didn't want to go through all the trouble.
I went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer I could find. This one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good. All excited to finally used it, I turn it on and within 10 seconds it goes to this weird sounding low setting. I thought I must have switched it to low on accident until I double checked and I didn't. Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds. It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush). The hot setting when it did decide to be hot (big reason I bought this) wasn't very hot either (which probably caused more frizz). This low quality defective hair dryer was not worth buying.
Didn't work very long.
Totally not worth the money.  Nothing special about it.
Unfortunately, I cannot give this item an accurate review.  I did receive it timely.  The item worked perfectly at home, however, when I arrived in Ireland the first thing I did was to plug it in to see if it worked and I don't know what happened from that point.  It seemed to lock into high speed and I could not move it so it blew out instantly.  I had to throw it out right there and then.  You have to use it on low speed but, I could not turn it off or move it to low speed.  It started smoking and out it went.  I'm just grateful that nothing more serious happened.
Beware, it doesn't work on HIGH when switched to 240 Volts.  I purchased this hair dryer to travel abroad.  I tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 Volts/ US and I loved it.  I was impressed at how powerful the HIGH speed setting was for a travel hair dryer.  Since I was headed to Europe I switched to 240 Volts and put it inside my suitcase. Once I arrived at my hotel I was very disappointed to find out, that once you switch to 240V you cannot flip the power switch to HIGH, you must try to dry your hair on the LOW setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer. At first I thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter's dryer ( I purchased two of these dryers since I was traveling with four teenage girls).  Their's did the same.  You can verify this at home, just put it on 240V and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged, you'll see that the switch won't move.  You can only go from OFF to LOW. If you are happy with the power at the LOW setting and your hotel doesn't provide a hair dryer, them this is better than nothing, otherwise don't even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer, you are better of just using the one the hotel provides.
This is my third one and have been pleased with the units in the past.  This unit has been  dramatically changed from the previous units.  The other ones had sturdy mounting hardware and the design was much better.  This new unit looks to be constructed rather cheap.<br />We like the light in the units but the last one didn't last near as long as the first one.  I have yet to hang and use this new one due to the fact I will need to plug holes and paint before I install it since the mounting is totally different.<br />I intend to keep the unit and will hang it in another bathroom but in the future I doubt if I buy another Andis.
not very impressed.
My work's locker room has the full sized dryer and I really liked it so I bought the travel version to take on a work trip.  I received one where the straightening cone (aka concentrator) spun around on the dryer, making it impossible to blow out your hair.  I returned it and got another one with the same issue.  Apparently, this is just a defect in the travel dryer.  It is a nice size for travel but I would give up the extra space in my bag for a dryer that worked for what I wanted.  If you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you.
I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.<br />The bonnet is adequate in size but the drawstring on the bonnet is so short that you can't expand the bonnet to a reasonable size to fit over curlers.  The bonnet connection to the hose doesn't fit securely so it is a juggling act to get the too tight bonnet on without disconnecting from the hose.<br />I will have to go shopping and find a dryer comparable to the Hot Tools unit that I have had for several yrs.  The bonnet finally tore but I have had 8 yrs of good use and the dryer unit is still going strong.  Too bad we can't just buy the replacement bonnets.
To bulky for travel.
I rarely write reviews, but I am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items I use most in my household. I bought this to replace my old Ionic 1875, which was on it's last legs from years of hard work. I am wishing that  I had bought a different dryer. The high setting is SO strong, and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if I just started there. I can deal with this, but what I hate is the 'cool' touch button, which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies. My last dryer did a great job with this feature, making my hair look smooth and shiny. But on this dryer, pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel. Why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super-dooper-strong like the high setting? It blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it!  I would have returned it if I could, but I bought it as back-up in case my old one broke, and too late by the time I actually opened it and tried it out. Thumbs down.
As is likely with all hair dryers that have the retractible cord, it already quit working and I bought it in October 2013. Eight months later already quit. The two stars it got is for ease of drying your hair.
Very underpowered dryer.  It has a nice power black finish which is totally spoiled by pink control buttons and end surround ring - it might appeal to teens or tweens, but aesthetically unpleasing to an adult.  I exchanged it the day i received it for a Conair Pro which is much better.
not a fan of this dryer, it does dry my hair quickly, however it leaves my hair dry, frizzy and dull.
I bought this dryer to replace a Revlon one that had a short in the cord.  This dryer did not blow hard enough or warm enough to dry my hair in a timely manner.  I'm returning it.
Gifted this to my mom in India. Since they use 220Volts in India, I needed something with dual voltage. What I realized was this dryer only works on the HIGH setting at 220V. I first thought the button was jammed, so tried again after switching to 120V and the button to switch high/low worked. I was very disappointed, but couldn't return the product since I was in another country and this was a gift.<br />I believe the product is designed that way, I wish they mentioned it. A low setting is critical to set a hairstyle or curl your hair.
i've normally loved my elchim blowdryers. this one did not make the cut. i felt like it was smaller and less powerful than my usual blowdryers. if i could return it, i would.
Reel slowly stops working over time.  6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract.
I received this hair dryer on 5/12/2014 and it is already broken!  It didn't even last 2 months!?!?!  I'm hoping I just got a lemon.
I bought it for my wife - but she tells me that it is no good. The heat is not strong enough and when used for longer than 2 mins it will just turn off, until it cools off.
Item broke after 3 uses.
I think the product is  fine, but I guess I didn't really think it out.  It is stationary, so if the dryer isn't moving, you are moving...your head all around...to hit the hot air.  plus, you can't mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there, its too far away.  you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around.  I guess I thought I could put on my face while blow drying, but that's not the case at all.
I only blow dry my hair straight about once a week.  Although I liked the blowdryer, I've had blowdryers last years.  I went through 2 in 2 years.  So:  Not so good.
Not enough power and doesn't get hot enough.  Next time I need one I will go back to Solano product.
WHEN USING HIGH SPEED SETTING. ORDERED &#62;&#62; Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt&#60;&#60; THAT HAS A LOT OF POWER ON HIGH SPEED SETTING.
I have used this type of blow dryer my whole life and thought I would try this brand.  The brush is way to soft.  I was going to return it, but missed the 30 day return window, so now it is in the guest bath.  I purchased the infinity pro by conair, and it was exactly what I needed.
This item was disappointing. I was hoping that it would pack the same punch as the larger version but it's not as strong.
Worked well until it burned out. Worked well with both voltage settings. It trash now. Would not recommend this dryer.
I splurged for a really nice blow dryer.  It was pretty quiet and did the job every other day - pretty normal usage.  But, this morning while using it, it just stopped.  I tried to unplug it from the surge protector and it had fused itself to it.  Not what I expected from an $80 hair dryer. I'm just glad it wasn't plugged into the wall.  Would NOT recommend.
I ordered this dryer  based on all the good reviews but also a little apprehensive because of of the few negative reviews, but because of the price, I decided to try it. I am glad I bought this hair dryer. It's very light and quiet and  I like that there is a cool air button so you don't have to keep your finger on it like most dryers. Great dryer for me!    I am now reviewing after 5 months of use.  WELL......it died on me today:-(  It did perform well while it worked! Disappointed!!!
This blow dryer does not get hot enough to straighten curly/thick hair using the tension method. I tried using this on myself; my hair is mostly wavy and with an loose s curl at the ends, and it did nothing for me. My sister tried this too and she has thick hair-- did not work for her either. I was disappointed because I bought this as a Christmas present for her because she needed a new blow dryer. I thought the John Frieda brand would prove useful. I didn't even bother returning it, I just sent it to my family to see if they would find some use for it. Perhaps this would work better for already straight hair or fine hair that you just want to dry faster than letting it air dry.
so I like it for a hairdryer but I bought is as a QUIET hairdryer for grooming a skittish pup and it is not quiet.
The dryer functions okay.  The plastic is weak.  Second time I used the attachments, the dryer body chipped.  Fortunately, it didn't effect the ability to connect the attachments; though I wonder how long this will work?  I will return to the &#34;other&#34; brand with my next purchase.
The quality of hair dryers are all over the map, just like the pricing. I've had cheap ones that have been outstanding, and expensive ones that have been horrible. This unit falls in between. While it is an 1875 watt Ionic, the heating/thermostat seems to be too variable. Even on the hottest setting it stays lukewarm unless you keep it on for longer then 5 minutes. I reminds me of a car warming up, in that it doesn't just start right away, you have to wait to get it right.<br />It is also a little bulkier than I imagined. I do not like the tiny ones, but I was looking for something that had some space considerations regarding storage. It is very large. Combine that with the heating issue and I could not recommend this, even at the price I paid.
My old Conair was great. This one is weak and the attachments fall off mid-use.  Will be replacing soon! Don't recommend.
The product design is lacking.  Controls on handle but not set-in so very easy to turn off while styling your hair.  Clumsy design.  May want to spend a little more for a quality product.  Not to be deceived by the picture.
It's definitely cute and Barbie-like. It does have an option for 250v or 110v... problem is, when in Europe even tho' it was on the 250v setting, both speeds were the same: HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT. I couldn't put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot. When I got back to the states I tried it on 110v and it had two speeds and two temps but still way too warm for a 'low' setting. I wasn't able to return it because I'd passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip. I will probably donate this... it doesn't really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp.
This dryer does not blow strong.  We need to use the concentrator attachment for it to work at all well.  The diffuser is a joke - you might as well blow on your own hair.  I bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500 - it is really not any better at all.
The high power is about a mid between low and what should be high.  Takes much longer to dry my hair with this.  I would not purchase this again even though it was priced low.
THIS DRYER JUST STOPPED WORKING ONE DAY.  I GUESS I WILL NEVER KNOW WHY, NOT WORTH IT AT ALL URGH
Very light weight and quiet, but controls are on the handle and are sharp... have to hold it at the very bottom of the handle so not to switch the settings, and smells like burning plastic...
Worked fine when I first receive it. Last night, after normal home usage, it burned out and is only fit for the garbage.
I wish I hadn't thrown away the packaging for this, because I would be returning it. I've never had a hair dryer that didn't get hot. This is a first.
This holder does hold a blowdryer but only in the downward position shown in the photo. The description says it can be adjusted up & down but that's not accurate. It can only be used down as shown in the photo & I don't know of anyone who just holds a blowdryer straight down to dry their hair. My blow dryer only fits in the holder pointed down. If I rotate it up, the blow dryer is stopped by the wall holding the holder. There's absolutely no chance of using any other angle. I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.  I guess holes have to be drilled through the tile to use it like in the photo. That wouldn't solve the rotation limitation problem. DIsapppointed!<br />DID arrive packed well & on time.
I ordered this hairdryer for the simple task of quickly drying my short hair. I did not use it for styling or anything complicated, just simply for drying. At first it worked fine. Five months later, the hot setting clicks off one minute into running the hairdryer, and when that happens, there is a flash of light inside the dryer. The cold setting is not warm enough to dry my hair, so essentially, it is now useless. I should probably need to stop using it anyways, because the flash indicates the there is something wrong with the wiring and it is not safe to use anymore. I went back to return it, but it is too late. Mind you, the one they sent me could have been just a fluke, but for me, it ended up being a waste of money.
I thought this would be an easier dryer for a young girl.  It's not.  It feels less powerful than my 6 year old Conair and the brush head that I thought would make it terrific is so flimsy-bristled it's useless.  My hair is fine and thin and the bristles just bend over if you try to use it.
The hair dryer that I received does not match the description. First of all, it does not look new, does not have a folding hand, and it's blue.
A month after receiving this dryer there was a problem with the switch when operated in the high position.  To make it operate you physically have to hold the switch in the high position. Wife said, she would use it and deal with the problem instead of being without a  hair dryer.  Other wise it performs as a hair dryer.
The pros:<br />It will work for travel. Small enough to fit in your hand<br />It has a switch you can turn with your fingernail or a screwdriver 125 to 250V<br />Cost<br /><br />The cons:<br />It's made of cheap plastic. The folding handle feels like it's going to break when I fold it.<br />It's REALLY noisy. The pitch will hurt your ears!<br />It didn't even remotely blow hot air. Essentially, you're blow drying on a lukewarm/cool setting<br /><br />Follow up: I ended up buying a<br />Conair YOU Reel 2-in-1 Folding Handle Hair Dryer which I LOVE. It worked perfectly in the UK with a 10 amp converter and my hair looked so much better than when it did using this blow dryer.
Its an OK dryer.....however it lasted EXACTLY 1 YEAR!!  My hair dryer which I use sporadically (since I go to the hair dresser very often) stopped working last week.<br /><br />Terrible.
Pros:<br /><br />Good amount of drying power considering how small it is<br />Perfect size for travel<br />Dual voltage works great--no explosions when I brought this dryer to Europe!<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Plastic piece that changes the voltage has fallen out twice! :-(<br />When using in Europe, the wind is very powerful....but that's good for me because my thick hair dries faster.<br /><br />Bottom line: I do like everything about the dryer except for that darn plastic piece that falls out. If that we're not an issue, this would get 5 stars.
Should've returned this. Not hot enough..at all, buttons are in weird place. As you're drying your hair, you inevitably hit the off button, or another speed. Super annoying.
I purchased this blow dryer a few months ago loved the product until it randomly DIED the other day. Fortunately I had saved my old one, or I would have had to leave the house in freezing weather with a wet head. Not pleased.
Whom ever designed this hair dryer had to be stoned! They put the power switch buy your pinky finger so your constantly turning the dryer off every time you grip the handle. The &#34;High&#34; heat is ok, could be better. But as the old saying goes...&#34;You get what you pay for!!&#34; So true.
So disappointed! Scrutinized the reviews before ordering this and totally disappointed.<br />Pros: The low, medium and high work fine. The cool shot, when held down works fine.<br />It does fold without issue.<br /><br />Cons: Thank goodness I decided to err on the side of caution and test this out as soon as I took it out of the box. The retractable cord DOES NOT RETRACT ALL THE WAY! There is a good 7&#34; of cord that can not be retracted because of a stopper that can not be moved or removed. The part that should fully retract did not, after 30 seconds of CAREFUL use.<br /><br />There is no diffuser. The little black piece that is shown in the pic does not a diffuser make.<br /><br />Ordered yesterday and returning today, enough said.
The power is not very high, which I was really hoping for. It's much less than that of the Conair Infiniti.
I've used this dryer for less than 4 months and it's already acting up.  I keep it clean and store it in a holder (so it doesn't drop to the floor) and it's still acting up.  The power level drops.  The heat comes and goes.  The manufacturer wants me to ship it back to them....and then they'll send me a new one in 10 days.  How am I supposed to live without a hairdryer for that long?!?!?!  I don't recommend this at all.
This died about a year after I got it. I wish it lasted longer. It was good while it lasted.
I order this after reading all the reviews. Before purchasing this blow dryer I had a very cheap bottom of the line dryer from walmart. I will have to say I am disappointed with how long it still takes to dry my hair. I was expecting more since for me this was an upgrade. It feels & looks cheap also.
Loved this blow dryer... BUT one night it got too hot too fast and went out! I thought it had died! But it was just hot and had to cool down overnight. I was only half dry!
Just not enough blow power compared to the one I had.  Takes too long to dry even on high.  No, I wouldn't buy it again.  Did not meet my expectations.
I purchased this hair dryer in July for a 2 week trip and since have only used it a few times. It was compact and easy to travel with. It isn't terribly powerful but worked well enough to dry my hair and works better than most hotel dryers. I had even used it a few times in place of my every day Conair dryer and had no major complaints. Until I used it for a recent trip and when I turned it on it puttered, then started smoking and sparking. I have seen hair dryers die before, but usually not after such limited use, and I haven't seen them go out in smoke and flames before. I usually buy Conair but this product has given me doubts.
I bought it to use in Italy. It worked for a day, then the motor burned out. I don't think the adapter is up to the job, the description is wrong.
Other than the retracting cord - which is cool - this is a pretty basic dryer. But I returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won't last long, and it just looks a little too cheap. I'm happy with the replacement - the Babylisspro TT for only a little more $ - looks nicer, feels nicer, works nicer, and is lighter.
I had a bed head dryer which i used for six + years.  I wore out the plug on it and replaced the 3 years ago.  One day, the replaced plug arc'd electricity and ruined the dryer.  :(  Because the bed head dryer I purchased was so great, I found this one with similar features as the previous one and purchased.  I used this one for six months and it was awful.  The dryer would over heat the exterior of my hair and not get the hair closer to my head dry.  Tried all different combination settings and it caused horrible frizziness and breakage in my hair - no matter the setting used.<br /><br />In January, I purchased a Hot Tools blow dryer and immediately frizziness went away.<br /><br />Do not purchase this dryer because it causes hair damage quickly.  My hair is extremely thick and curly with highlights and length is midway down my back..
I bought it because of the low price and beautiful color, but tne item's color is so different from the picture. The most feature that diappointed me is my hair always roll into the back of it and the dryer broke my hair a lot, I strongly recommended people do not buy this product. I just don't want bother to return it, this is the only reason I keep it.
Replaced it because there was no difference between the heat settings.  The dryer didn't get hot enough to dry my short hair in less than 10 minutes.
It is lightweight however it is very loud and it is not as powerful as i thought. I ended up buying another one a few months later.
First I will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer so I guess it does what it's supposed to do.  But, the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best.  Every time I change hand positions I'm accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm.  The only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle - I've dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than I can count while trying to avoid turning it off!  All other dryers I've ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to, not just if you accidentally touch it.  And the cord is very short as well - much shorter than any I've had in the past.  This dryer will be going to &#34;back-up&#34; status as soon as I get a better replacement.
Bulky and heavy, the cord doesn't fully retract into the unit.  The power switch broke on the third use so I couldn't shut it off and had  to unplug while running.  Returned.
Purchased this model because it had all the features I was looking for. After about 5 weeks it will not heat up only blows barely warm air.
Got this for the wife, who uses it once/ twice a week. For a while she was happy with it, but then it started work intermittently with the heat cutting off and then it completely stopped heating up. We had had many blow dryers in the past and they usually last a couple of years, even the cheap ones, so its pretty disappointing for a 'professional' grade product to last less than a year in a light use household environment.
I ordered this hair dryer for an upcoming European trip.  I chose the black colored dryer over the white and got a different product.  The black is only for USA use and is lower voltage than the white.
As another reviewer pointed out, this dryer does not sit flush with the wall.  You can see the metal mounting plate behind the unit.  There is at least a 1/4 inch gap between the wall and dryer.  If seems to work fine otherwise.<br /><br />If you're worried about the finished look of the product, do not buy this.
I purchased this hair dryer as a gift. The recipient did not like how bulky and heavy it was so I ended up returning it. I also tried the hair dryer prior to returning it. I feel that it did not have the necessary amount of actual heat I need to dry my hair in a timely fashion. I was attempting to do a blow-out as I normally do and this really did not help straighten out any waves/curls.
This hair dryer arrived today and I used it to dry my hair.  It took forever to get my hair almost dry by which time I gave up on it.  My last hair dryer dried my hair in 5 min, this one took 20 and wasn't totally dry.  The switches for the heat and speed are right where you put your fingers and very sensitive, so it was difficult to keep from switching temps or speeds.  After my hair was done, it was flat and limp and definitely not shiny.  No volume at all.  Don't waste your money.
This hair dryer is heavy. And pretty huge. Also, it's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers, so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use. When set on hot/high, the velocity of the air is very good, but it's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying, but certainly not good for styling. It did minimize my static flyaway hair, but since I had to use my old &#34;hot&#34; dryer to style, I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair. The price was good, hence the two stars, but I don't recommend. Probably better for short hair.
This hairdryer did not hold up well.  The attachments do not stay on very well and the plastic around the handle is peeling off.  I would not recommend.
I don't know if its lack of skills on my part or lack of quality in this product but it just doesn't do what I expected. Also, when I used the highest setting I literally, not exaggerating, burned skin off my thumb. I don't know if I touched the dryer or my hair while it was hot because when it happened I didn't feel it at first. I don't want to return it because I'm still hoping I can make it work for me.<br />When I get someone who knows how to make my hair look the way I want with this dryer I'll update.
Switches are hard to push up and down , hard to operate with one hand. Switches get stuck and need both hands to operate. Not user friendly.
I purchased this dryer for a relative and I did not really like it.  I noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right and sometime does not work at all.  I see paint coming off.  I am told this hairdryer is really hot in temperature, perhaps to hot for hair drying.  Did not meet my expectations.  I would not recommend dryer to a friend or relative... Prompt delivery.  R. Dawson
I got the status of being an unhappy customer becasue of this product.  It didn't look NEW and it was packaged poorly.  However, I didn't want to waste the time to return it.  If this is the first time that I have heard from you, then so be it  I bought this in the summertime.  YES I an unhappy about this product and I still do care for it.......
I have gone through too many of these dryers. It is my favorite in terms of how great it blows hair straight. But they break too easily and for that price, I had to go with something that i don't like as much but that lasts. Mine burnt out within 2 months and I could not return it by the time I got back into the country from my travels.
Weak blower as well. Why is it the old school Conair dryers would last for YEARS through the worst abuse, but these POS can't last 12 MONTHS under once per week use?  Supposed to be a one year warranty parts and labor. At $11 for a new unit, will cost more to ship to repair center than to buy a new one. Conair knows this unit is junk, hence the $11 price tag. What else is new?
I thought it would be smaller and more compact.  Much too big for travel.  I was better of with a simple blow dryer.
Not even one month, it was borken already, and I don't really use it that often. At first I liked it, because It's light weight and fast dry you hair. But it didn't last long.
This dryer is professional quality and, it does work very well if you have the muscles to operate.  It is too heavy to travel with.
I'm honestly not one to write reviews but do rely heavily on them and this item was rated very high by Amazon customers who purchased it.  I have to admit, I really, really liked it until it just simply stopped working.  It is lightweight and powerful and fairly quiet for a blow dryer.  I was real happy with it until it just recently stopped working...conveniently right outside the 1 year limited warranty.  I didn't misuse or drop it and I kept the filter clean so not sure what happened but I know my last blow dryer lasted for years.  It was working when I gave it away when I got this one.  So, not so thrilled but maybe it was a fluke.  Who knows.
I liked this hair dryer while it worked. It was light and didn't tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn't extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair. I think it might have just been a lemon, because I know sometimes there's just going to be defective items in a group. Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.
The hand controls seem very flimsy and there are only two heat setting and when I set it at hot, it give me warm air at most.  I'd return it but I aready threw the box away.
I like the folding handle but don't feel like the dryer gets hot enough to dry my hair very fast.
I received this blow dryer today and it is NOT an Infiniti blow dryer. It is just a regular Conair blow dryer.
It was just what I wanted and worked great for a few months, then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired. No way to fix it, so it went into the garbage!
Purchased in December 2011. Worked great up until November 2013. It behaves as if there is a short. I suspect it involves the retractable cord. I'll shy away from another retractable cord product.
VERY LOUD!  I bought this to give to my wife to replace her old hair dryer.  This one is so noisy it sounds like she is drying her hair with a jet engine!
Blows hard and hot if needed. Had to disconnect night light, so bright, could be used as a street light. Also, loud enough to be used on a train, will wake everyone in the house with the door closed. Had a different brand for five years before, that was perfect, should have re-ordered the same.
This was great when it worked. I have a small bathroom and it was the perfect solution until it stopped working shortly after purchase. I should have returned it. I do not recommend this unit.
The external head of Hair dryer consistently comes out and does not stick in the place. the heat and cold are good, but overall it's not made from the best quality materials. I wont recommend it to any one
This hair dryer not hot enough and the motor was slow.  I have fine hair and when using this it made my hair freezy
this dryer is: clumsy, clumsy attachements, I don't like the gold paint, it's hard to hold, I never use it.
This dryer worked well when I got it, but it didn't last. I was very disappointed with it, especially for this price.
I was hoping for a powerful travel dryer, like the rest of T3 dryers. I had to return it, not powerful enough for me. You can get much cheaper travel size dryers that will do the same job.
I have had many other twin turbo dryers. I feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power, and it is too small , and doesnt fit right in my hand.The heat is no where near as hot as it used to be. The only reason that I didnt return it was because of my own laziness. I will keep it as a second dryer, i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo.
UPDATE: I know this dryer was only $20 but it died after ~1.5 years. This is the first dryer to ever stop working for me, which isn't the best morning surprise. The rest of my review stands. the concentrator never fell off.<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer because the concentrator(?) on my old hair dryer always fell off. One day it started taking my hair with it. I bought the Conair Turbo Styler because the concentrator looked like it would never fall off. I've had this for a few months now, and it definitely stays put.<br /><br />The heat is on the lower end, I have fine hair so that works for me. I wouldn't advise this dryer for somebody with very thick hair.
For the longest time I was trying to figure out what the bad smell was in my bathroom.  Turns out it's the plastic piece that covers where the cord meets the dryer.  It smells a little like asparagus pee!  Totally confusing and I kept cleaning until I figured it out.  It's been weeks now and while the smell is getting better, I still smell it.  If you have a good sniffer, like I do, you probably want to avoid this product.
The diffuser is very small and the hair blows all over . The dryer itself works fine I am a hairdresser and usually don't see a travel size diffuser except for the socks which I do not like so I was disappointed when this did not work well at all too much airflow through the diffuser.
Bought the first one at an RV store and it lasted for several years of daily use. When it finally wore out, bought another one (same model). After about 6 months of use, the wires in the handle had been pinched and shorted out and damaged the unit. Bought another one. My wife has been using it for the last several months and this morning there was a pop and the low speed quit. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because is  a really nice unit that we have liked, but wondering now about the quality control on recently produced units.
The wind is strong when it works fine. However, it does not work today. I only bought it for 9 months. I know cheap stuffs do not last long. But my expectation is at least one year. I would rather choose a more expensive but better quality one next time.
Have been using the Conair walmount dryers for years.  The new one that I ordered don't really seem to have quite as much air movement as they did in the past, although not really sure due to it is so much quiter maby just appeares to be that way.  Also on the old ones, I could just take it from the wll mount bracket and use it like a regular Blower, or just put a new one in an old prewall mounted bracket.  On this one I had to cut the cord and re splice it, due to it being hooked to the Light so It would not just come out of the wall mount bracket  without cutting the cord.<br /><br />Jerry
I have fine straight hair that takes hardly anything to dry, but this dryer isn't even up to the task.  It blows air on your hair and I'm sure speed along the drying process, but I wasn't able to use it for styling as it had neither enough heat nor enough power.  The one time I tried I got my hair tangled in the fan despite the screen guard and burned out the motor.
I bought this blow dryer about 14 months ago and it worked great when I got it but now it's not blowing strong, it's feels like it's on a low setting instead of high. I'm looking for a new blow dryer because I know this one is about to die.
I would not buy this hair dryer again.  I have had it for exactly 1 year and it performed ok until today. It is 5 days past the warranty period and it just broke. Sparks started coming out of the back of the unit and my entire bathroom smelled like it was on fire.<br />I do not wash my hair daily. This product was used 2-3 times a week. I also regularly cleaned the back filter of any dust or debris, so I am pretty disappointed I only got 12 months out of it!<br /><br />Even before it stopped working I was not all that impressed with it. It dried my shoulder length fine hair in marginally shorter time than a regular dryer and I did not really notice a difference in added shine.<br /><br />I will be placing an order for this cheap Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, which I purchased to replace my MIL's ancient one last year. This Revlon hair dryer I AM really impressed with. Super light weight and dries hair in record time.
Not Enough Heat!  The dryer does not get hot enough! I don't know if it is defective or by design that the air flowing from the dryer is not Hot enough and in not what I am used to compared to other dryers.  The original box was taped up, it might have been a return item.  Too late to return!
I bought this hair dryer in mid Jan 2013.  It had all the power of my beloved previous hair dryer, weighed much less and cost less as well.  It is now mid October 2013, a mere 10 months later,  and starting my brand new job, I went to dry my hair after my shower and it just wouldn't turn on. I reset the dryer. I reset the outlet.  I tested my curling iron on the same outlet and it turned on.  I tested the hair dryer on a different outlet in another room and it still wouldn't turn on.  I was a very light user since I had it.  I never left it out or even left it plugged in.  I always put away after each use.  The dust catch on the back end was still not even dusty.  Just dead for no reason.  Will be exploring the 12-month limited warranty on the manual, but don't know what compensation that will yield.  Will have to go back to Conair Pro Ceramic since it always served me very well without fail.
This hair dryer is mediocre. The attachments fall off and the high/low is difficult to use while drying my hair. I gave it away.
This was my first 'expensive' dryer, and I was very happy with it initially. After 3 months, the Speed setting stopped working - the dryer only works on HIGH now. Manufacturer's website has no information about warranty. Very disappointing.
This is light weight and has a lot of bells and whistles.  However, for smoothing hair, I thing the Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer reg and travel, are much better.
Exceeded my expectations while it worked.  I read the reviews about the hair dryer suddenly dying, but gambled that it wouldn't happen to me.  Wrong.  Turned it on this morning and nothing happened.  Completely dead.  I will contact Remington but don't expect the problem will be remedied.<br /><br />Oh well, the search continues.
I returned it, no questions asked. Not only was it too heavy for me, it also blew too hot for me on low.
Everything was great for about 6 month, the it stop working, why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months?, Better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive.  One thing is certain, I will not buy a Remington drier ever!!
The hose falls off the cap a lot. It is easy to store and travel with. The hose is hard to get to stay on the cap. It keeps falling off.  Took about 5-7 minutes to get it to the point where it stays on the cap. Hose is short too.
This product burned out after about 7 months of once a day, short usage. it is not reliable as this is the second (and last) one I have owned.
I purchased this because I wanted a wall-mounted dryer with sufficient power to dry my shoulder-length hair. I liked the cord storage and night light features, as well as the fact that we could use it on 1200 or 1600W settings based on who in the family is using it. It seemed to have the ingredients for a great little wall-mounted dryer. However, the dryer keeps shutting itself off (motor just stops blowing) when I dry my hair for more than 3-4 minutes. Once it cools down for a minute or two it starts again, but I have to tell you, this is a seriously annoying problem. I would not buy this again, and am pretty disappointed.
OK for the price.. nothing special. I wish I would have chose something else.. take too long to dry my hair
So I purchased this hair dryer in March 2013 and I need a new one already.  While it worked it was good but then things went wrong as I dry my hair I see a spark like when you pull a plug out of the wall.  I don't know if it is because I use a metal brush but it snaps and then sparks not so great.
I had this dryer for a about four months until the motor/fan began to spark and I decided it was no longer safe to use. Prior to this however, it worked wonderfully. Shame it broke.
So, we bought this dryer as a replacement for my wife's old, loud unit.<br /><br />Unboxed it, and it felt nice and solidly built. And it was about mid-range, volume wise. Also a good selection of heat and fan-speed adjustments. But, the first morning of use, it ran for about 3-4 minutes, then the breaker-plug began to buzz loudly, and emit smoke.<br /><br />All use was discontinued, and was returned for a refund.<br /><br />I award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit, but subtract 3 for failing. This seems like a fluke, as most of the reviews are positive, but I'm going to be searching for a different dryer anyway.
Nothing special here.  Just a very basic hair dryer.  I like the color and the cord, but not the drying power.
It was way too loud, does not dry the hair as fast as other hair dryers. It pulls way too much current making all the places were I have used it tryp the brakers..... Was not happy at all and gave it away
Extremely loud.  The concept of the side usage is fantastic and that is what I am searching for.  This product is just too loud.
I ordered 2 of these dryers and returned both.  My hair is very thick and it didn't blow hard enough nor hot enough to dry my hair.  If you don't have really thick or long hair--it will probably work just fine.
For all the loud sounds it makes, you'd think it was fiercely blowing air, but you'd be wrong.  It gets hot, but the air volume is low.  If stolen, I'd buy something else.
I have had this hairdryer for about two years and I have to replace it.  At about the one and half year mark it started emanating a horrible smell.  I take care of my things--there is nothing I can see that found its way inside that would be causing this smell.  Even prior to this issue I was never impressed with this product.  It never had a lot of power.  Wouldn't recommend it.
I have owned an older version of this Sunbeam hair dryer that worked well for many years -- I'm thinking at least 10.  Unfortunately, this model was purchased just several months ago and already the On switch will not always catch.  I have to keep pushing it or the Off button to get it to work. Often I find, also, that the red Reset switch was triggered.  I haven't yet contacted the company, but hope very much that they or Sunbeam will make a complimentary replacement.  If so, I will write a new review.  If not, never again will I buy a Sunbeam.<br /><br />New review:  The company from which I bought this hair dryer stands behind their product.  I have been sent a replacement as well as prepaid postage to return the original.  I am very pleased with this company's customer service.  I do hope that this Sunbeam product is free from defects.  A wall-mounted hair dryer can certainly be convenient.
I bought this model for the retractable cord and folding handle.  After using it 2-3 times/week for the last 2 1/2 months, the cord has frayed in one place and it has stopped retracting.  On the plus side, it was an effective hair dryer, but there are several that work as well.
design is ugly, cord to electic outlet is great lenght, heat settings are fine, setting for blowing are fine<br />the curly cord from the unit to handle is way to short - will not reach more than 2 1/2 feet<br />hard to reach mirror and dryer is handing on wall only 1 inch from the mirror
This is the noisiest hairdryer I have ever used. Apart from waking anyone who might have been sleeping, it was headache inducing. It operates well and looks good but the noise factor was unbearable. I am not a whinger and am pretty easy to please but this was not worth keeping and was returned.
It doesnt do what it says, its not as described,my hair is static not very powerful, compare to other hairdryers
This hair dryer was loud and cheaply made. I returned it! The fan was rattling and very loud. I would not recommend.
This hair dryer did not work after 2 weeks. I would not recomend anyone purchasing this hair dryer.  No manufacture info on box either.
I am writing this review to save anyone interested in this dryer to beware!  If you have thick hair you will not find this brush to be adequate.  I have medium long hair and am white, but my hair is very thick.<br />I know this dryer style is usually advertised for African Americans but it works well for caucasians with thick hair as well.  I found a different dryer that is working great.  Conair is the manufacture.<br /><br />Other than the brush this dryer appears to be well constructed.  I did not use it so I can say how well it drys.
I was hoping that this Revlon drier was a great bargain, and that its price of $12 wasn't an indication of a cheap or shoddy product.  When it arrived, I was chagrined.  It was a very light, very cheap feeling product, which also only had two possible heat settings.  All in all, a very unimpressive hair dryer; I guess sometimes you do get what you paid for.
I have bought 3 of these in 5 years, they fall apart one way or another. I will in no way buy a 4th.
I have owned this dryer in the past and this was a replacement after 3 years of my old one! This one must have been refurbished or defective because it didn't perform well after only 6 months. I went into Ulta and purchased a new t3 in person. Hope it lasts better than this one.
Dryer is very loud and it broke down after 6 months of usage... will not recommend it to other buyers.
I should first mention that I don't use this item in the typical way.  I never use the attachments as my hair is super short (2 inches), I just figured the shape would allow me to straighten my hair more efficiently.  It's a bit cumbersome and heavy.  It gets plenty hot and the low heat setting, although weak, is good for gradual straightening.  I don't like that you have to hold the cool shot button, plus it takes a lot of effort to press.  The button is placed in a very awkward spot for the way I hold it, facing down (again, not typical).  The brush attachment is useless because it's softer than hair!  I imagine this item would be more useful for someone with longer hair.
Revlon RVDR5005 Ion Select 1875 Watt Travel Dryer<br /><br />Product works as it should, however, the concentrator styling attachment won't stay on.  I was away for 18 days after purchase and now find out I have exceeded the time for returning the hair dryer for a full refund.  I am not a happy Amazon shopper and will probably not purchase items from you again.
Revlon has usually been a tried and true product for me. But this particular hair dryer is not good. I will return it and go into a store to test them out. This dryer has a very tin sounding motor and the air coming out of the machine is minimal. Very disappointing.
The bonnet tore after three uses so that air flow was impeded.  After the tear, the air would not flow to the top of the bonnet.  I could not find a replacement bonnet when I searched online.
My hair gets caught and yanked if I get the dryer to close to my head. Also, it weighs too much.
It takes a few seconds to get the hot air and the plastic attachments fall off. I wouldn't buy again.
It does dry the hair fast, but it really damaged my hair. It would get my hair so dry and fuzzy. I tried it twice, nad then gave it to someone else. I wouldn't recommend this at all.
Not crazy about the diffuser, which is what I bought it for.  I have wavy hair and this doesn't really work for my hair - it leaves it looking limp and seems like it takes longer to dry my hair than my old hair dryer.  It is lightweight.  Maybe it works better for straightening?
The socket blow up and got alot of sparkles make me so scary throw it away and didnt use it again ever
This dryer is powerful enough it just produces luke warm air.  It was very convenient to install as clippped right on to the existing sunbeam plate bracket.
The styling of blow-dryer is great; the functions are not! The cool down button feature was pressed once for use, but got stuck inside of unit wobbling around, but would not release back so the warm mode. The 240 V option only worked on the low feature. Also, I found the brush attachment flimsy, not firm and would eventually wear out quickly. SUB-STAND FEATURES ruined a great looking unit! Quality would be the remedy! This could have been a winner...sad;(
This dryer was not as small as I expected it to be .  Also was not as light as I wanted.
This dryer takes a very long time to dry my fine, wavy, chin length hair (20 minutes or more). I think the problem is weak airflow. Also, the styling nozzle keeps falling off, which is really annoying. I've had this dryer only six months, and am already investing in a new dryer of a different brand.  I thought the problem was my hair until I blow dried my own hair at my salon with my stylist's dryer, and it came out shiny and beautiful in so much less time. Since I use the same brush and product as her, I know it must be the dryer. For an inexpensive dryer, I preferred the Andis. I am paying a little more for my next dryer which is supposed to be of better quality.
I've had this hairdryer for less than a year and its button functions  are not working anymore even though the hairdryer itself is in perfect condition.<br />It is a shame that Conair uses such cheap materials for their products.
This design with the hook to hang the cord on is great, but the dryer itself only has two modes: &#34;Off&#34; and &#34;Burn your scalp off Hot.&#34;
I had the old Silver bird and it was so much better than the new one that is being sold now in some stores. The old one was really hot and straightened my hair so much better. This new one seems to even vibrate a bit when using and just feels cheap. It takes longer now to blowout my hair. You can tell if it's the old one because the word silverbird looks like the one shown.
This Hair Dryer popped up when I searched for dual voltages hair dryer. I was disappointed to find out it was not after receiving the product. I decided to keep it because at least it is fold-able. However when I took it to my Eastern Europe tour, it burned out on the first day & even blew the fuse of my hotel room. Hotel electrician had to come to re-set my room's fuse at 11 PM. Luckily my voltage transformer did not burn out so I had no problem keep on charging my cell phone & my tablet for the rest of the tour; otherwise my trip would be totally ruined.
Bought this in July 2012, broke after 9 months worth of use. Not sure what the reason was, and I didn't bother to take it to the repair shop so it's going to the recycle bin. There were sparks of fire in the wire inside the hair dryer and I did not know what to make of it. Decided to give it up
This blow dryer was great for the first year and a half (bought it brand new), but just recently it started to spark every time I used it. At first I thought it may have been a little glitch, but it's been sparking every time now. I have stopped using it so my hair and or face doesn't catch on fire! Scary!
I have a previous conair blow dryer and it works great. it has so much power. The only reason why I purchased a second one is because I wanted a concentrator nozzle which mine did not have and i never found one wide enough to fit my dryer. So that is why I gave it a low rating.
For home use, this dryer is okay. it works fine. I like the retractable cord. It's bulky and would take up way too much room in a suitcase. The diffuser barely fits in my bathroom drawer with this dryer. I'm either returning it donating it to a homeless shelter.
Gets way too hot for something to be used by a child!!  We turned it on and visible red hot coils could be seen within seconds.  And the air was blistering hot.  I cannot see a younger child using this without adult supervision.  We returned it.
Has a nice holding grip.. Makes alot of noise and pushes very little heat. Could be that I was just unlucky with this one.
I purchased a hot tools blow dryer and they sent me a Helen of Troy blow dryer that looked exactly the same except for a few details. they put it in a hot tools box and everything looked exactly the same. I am disappointed because I like the brand hot tools and they never said anything about Helen of troy. the dryer works fine and everything but it had dust and dirt smudges on it when I got it.
A couple of months after I purchased this hair dryer, the ceramic started peeling all over the dryer - especially around the handle and the nozzle. Not only is it nasty looking, but the material flakes all over the place, including in my hair while I'm drying it. The dryer still works fine, but I would never recommend it.
This blowdryer is okay. I orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and I also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon. The filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it! it drives me crazy! So everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter! The smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it.
Purchased product 9/7/2012.  By 4/6/2013, the product does not work.  The dryer is not overused - 2 times per week, maximum.  I call Helen of Troy products to make a complaint.  I have to pay the cost of shipping the product back to them and wait a minimum of two weeks for them to return a replacement to me.
not sure where other reviewers are coming from ,but i do not like this low dryer..it is way too cold even on warm setting and not strong enough..if it wasnt too late i would return it..plus the knobs are cheap plastic and about to fall off after 2 mos! waste of money!
I ordered this blow dryer pictured and the one I received was a blue and black one. There was nothing on the page when I ordered that said they could come in different colors so I was very disappointed. The blow dryer itself is fine I just don't think they should send a different color than pictured.
It broke on me on the second use...Looks and feels cheap.  I rather pay more for a higher quality product.
I thought this was a more powerful dryer...my bad. I'm going to keep it since I like the color (LOL) and it dries well  with a high and low setting and 2 speeds, and has concentrator and attachment for curls. Both attachments are very tough to take off...I'm so afraid I'll break one of them....they need a better system to get them on and off. The dryer is only 1275 watts, not exactly powerful. And, very important, the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small, and placed badly. I keep accidentally turning off the blower!
I don't blow bry my hair often but I have to say this dryer doesn't get very hot. I have curly hair so I have been doing the air dry thing for a long time until someone showed me how to use the curly hair thingy, (you know the big circle thing with fingers). So I thought this dryer would do the trick. I think it does the job,but considering I have had not even a year yet, I wouldn't recommend it.
I returned this hair dryer because, from the very beginning, the cord didn't retract. And, as some reviewers noted, it did seem surprisingly heavy for a travel hair dryer.
I like this hair dryer. Had another one exactly the same befor and lasted a few years. I never minded that it was a little hard to slide on and off.<br />The retractable feature broke immediately. What a shame.
Purchased October 2011, broke March 2013.  So only lasted 1 year and 5 months.  Used it only 2 times every week, so it was gently used.  Will replace it with a different brand.
I have owned a hot tools hair dryer -  model 30001 -  but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke.  I was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer.<br />However -  the thermostat setting is too too hot..  I cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting -  I have  managed to &#34;get the job done&#34; by starting on the middle setting as long as I can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers.  My Model 30001 had five heat settings.<br /><br />In addition to this the new dryer is very nosy - almost has a whistle to it.  The bonnet is heavier and not as flexible.<br />In short - I am not happy with the new dryer - do you have another model with more heat settings?<br /><br />A problem with both models -  the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying.
I loved the idea of a retractable cord, but that's about the only good thing about this dryer.  It is big and heavy, but the worst part is that it vibrates like crazy - very uncomfortable!
If you use a brush attachment, don't bother with this dryer!  Also, the high, medium and lowsettings only manage heat.  There is no difference in the force of the air flow.  If you have medium to thick hair, this dryer won't provide enough power to dry your hair in a reasonable lenght of time.  This dryer is weak.  I would only recommend it for people with fine or short hair.
not recommend this one. it was broken when arrive. This one dries my hair in a really really slow way!!
This is a bulky and hard to handle hairdryer. It would get to hot. I sent it back for a refund. I don't recommend it.
It only has two intensity levels, either too low or too high and loud. The hairdryer blew off the electricity in my apartment TWICE!
I liked the price of this hairdryer. It was great during the first 2 weeks but then It blew off and stopped.
I initially really liked this dryer.  I liked it enough that I bought two, one from Target and one from Amazon.  It's been a litte under a year and both have serious problems.  One no longer gets very warm, and when held at certain angles it looses power.  The other one is warm, but the speed/force decreased dramatically a few months ago, and now it's sparking inside while I use it.<br /><br />I usually expect 2-4 years out of a hair dryer, and for me to have two of these, for less than one year, speaks very poorly of the line of dryers.
I only gave this a 2 star because i have medium to short hair and after 3/4 of an hour it did'nt dryit. i would not recomend this.
I liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working. The retractable cord didn't really work so well after the first few months. You had to push it in.
Even though it is the same wattage it does not seem to have any power.  I am sure that it is every dryer
I love being able to have a salon quality style from home.  This little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl.  BUT the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far.  I have had to duct tape the hose together.  I would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing.
I've had this hair dryer for 9 months and use it daily, but now am ready to give up on it and try a different brand. In the beginning, it worked pretty good, but it didn't take long for things to stop working correctly. Today was the final straw; after blow drying my hair this morning, it smells burnt. I'm getting rid of this thing before it starts a fire!<br /><br />PROS<br />*Comes with lots of accessories<br />*Dries hair quickly<br />*Back opens so that dust filter can be cleaned<br /><br />CONS<br />*Cool button stopped working after a few months<br />*LOUD<br />*Risk of fire/burnt hair<br />*Did not last long
This hair dryer works just fine but it was not as compact as I expected it to be.<br /><br />It seems that with the ability for the cord to retract, they had to make the handle part fatter.  For someone with smaller hands, it's a bit more effort to hold the dryer up.  And on top of that, the dryer is pretty heavy which makes it even harder to hold it up straight for an extended time.<br /><br />If you are smaller built and want things small and light, then this may not be the dryer for you.
This dryer was really heavy.<br />It hurts my arm when I drying my long hair.<br />So I am using with dryer stand.<br />The strength is good and sometimes it sparks.<br />Cheap and cute. That's it!!
I received this hair dryer in December of 2012, tried to use it in January of 2013, lifted the hood and a piece snapped off. Now my hair dryer hood does not stay in place. I cannot use this item and do not recommend it because it is not durable.
I gave this to my sister as a birthday gift along with the hair straighter this worked great for  her until it just stoped working out of nowhere we tried everything from the reset but to calling costumer service nothing helped horrible product
No side vents, so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot, while the sides and back are still wet.  On high, it's very loud.
It is what it is for a $20 hairdryer. I didn't notice anything better or worse then most hairdryers I have owned except that it does automatically shut off if you use it too long. I guess it overheats? It will pop the circuit and I let it cool a bit and then hit the reset and it works fine again. If you have thick hair that takes a while to dry this would not be the hairdryer for you.<br /><br />UPDATE: So a few months later and this hairdryer has turned out to be not so great after all. It overheats quickly if it is on high for more than a minute, even though I have cleaned the dust screen, and it shuts off. Very annoying.
I would return this but it's been too long. I almost immediately went back to my old dryer after a couple of times. I have since found another dryer on Amazon that I just received and it's doing a wonderful job.
This dryer is not featherweight like it says in the name.  It weighs about the same as the one I was already using.  My hair does not dry any faster and is not made any smoother than it was with my old dryer.  It's not bad, just ordinary.
This hairdryer is way too bulky,big, heavy. Makes so much noise that it almost sound like airplane propeller. This is going back.
I was looking for a smaller unit than this and stil I am.; the one I got is still to bulky to go in my bags.
My wife has used this dryer for eleven months without complaint, UNTIL NOW!  This morning, all six internal blower blades literally just suddenly fell apart.  What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades.  It's obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can't hold up.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
This dryer is only 1800 watts -  I am sorry I didn't read closer, if the wattage was noted, and purchase a more high-powered dryer.  I didn't return this one because I discarded everything before realizing it.<br />Mary in VA
It is very noisy! I was looking for a quiet hair dryer. I would recommend to update a description. I have a old hair dryer that is much more quiet the Conair 225R Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer
It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  It really looked like a toy.  I didn't read the details close enough, I guess so I didn't realize it was only 1200 amps instead of 1875.  I decided to give t to a little girl instead of the adult I originally purchased it for.
It's more or less sufficient for my thin hair and semi-bald head, but the hottest setting is no more than warm-ish.  Other than that, works well.
Had this item for a year now and it just broke on me, so I figured I needed to write a review to warn buyers. When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn't close all the way but it really didn't bother me much. I've had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn't purchase again.
I expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews.  It wasn't as powerful as I like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer, so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused.  The thing I'm most unhappy with is the cord.  I always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because I can't stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer.  Every other dryer that I've had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out.  This dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging.  It is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day.  I'm still deciding if I should return it or not.
I purchased this dryer because I wanted a compact, easily portable dryer for travel & the idea of a retractable cord was appealing.  It is NOT compact.  In fact, it's quite large &  I returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough.  It isn't ergonomic & it's heavy.  I ended up buying the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer &  I am thrilled with it.  I have shoulder-length fine hair.
It's a lot of work. I hate blow drying my hair as I have very long and curly hair. This blow dryer does not make it any better or faster of a process.
I ordered this because I was looking for something to speed up the drying process for my long hair and decided to try this one based on the fast dry ionic feature.  The product dries my hair OK but I can't see any difference in the time it takes compared to my old blow dryer.  The things I don't like about it are:<br />1.  It's really big.  I had to reorganize my bathroom because it wouldn't fit in the drawer my old blow dryer occupied.<br />2.  It's really big (again) - I have small hands so it's uncomfortable and unwieldy to hold and operate.  One small plus is that, although it's huge it's thankfully not very heavy.<br />3.  Watch out for the buttons!  They are placed on the handle in a way that allows you to accidentally turn the hair dryer off, change the drying speed or the temperature while you are trying to dry your hair.  Since this just happened AGAIN to me I decided to write this review!  It's uncomfortable to try and hold a huge hair dryer while having to constantly watch the position of your hand on the handle where the buttons are located so as not to change a setting while operating.<br />I'll keep this because it's easier than returning it but if I had it to do over again I would not purchase this particular hair dryer.
I was going to buy a Babyliss but i ordered this one. It was a mistake since it is more expensive and it didnt last long. Now it takes forever to dry. I had many customers complain about it.
I have been using the Twinturbo 3200 everyday for 11 months. I bought it because I wanted a hair dryer that would blow very hot air. It worked great for about 9 months. After 9 months, the hot air wouldn't stay hot after 5 minutes of being on; it turns to warm air. Also, the diffuser falls off very often while the hair dryer is on. It's quite startling. My previous hair dryer was a SuperSolano that I used everyday for 6 YEARS before it failed. I do not recommend the Pibbs Twinturbo!! I am very disappointed with it.
This hairdryer gets very hot, but not much air blows out compared to other (I have an older conair that I love) hairdryers. It's also very heavy.
I do not recommend the purchase of this product. It does dry your hair,however, the attachment does not lock in place and makes it very frustrating and awkward to use.
I was disappointed with this hair dryer.  I needed a quiet hair dryer so I wouldn't wake my family when I get ready early in the morning.  While advertised as being quiet, it is no different than the regular hair dryers we have.  Very disappointing.
this dryer is a waste of money, the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries. you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair, and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top it just burns a few spots and doest really affect the rest of your hair. this is only good for people with really straight fine hair. not for rollers or any types of styling .....
Night light quit working after a week. The dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer.
Got this for travel purposes. Used it 2-3 weeks ago. Takes longer to dry my hair (which I expected due to less wattage) and it makes my hair more frizzy (which I did not expect). This is in comparison to the Revlon Rv544blu Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Dryer, which I also got from Amazon. The product came exactly as shown in picture.
i bought this product about a year now and i have to say there are other blowers that work better than this one that are way cheaper for the price it has a high pressure of hair coming out and it is light but it does not silk the hair no matter how much you go over the same section of hair i would not buy agian. and yes i am a dominican hair stylish
This product was listed as a 2000 Watt Ceramic/Ionic hairdryer.  It certainly had 2000 watts and was as loud and powerful as a jet engine in my bathroom.  However, despite the power, the heat was lacking.  And, it was so powerful, it was difficult to control fly-aways.  Not recommended for curly hair where you are trying to control frizz and defeat humidity.  Too powerful, but not hot enough to help.
Based on mostly positive reviews I purchased this hair dryer - usually the reviews on Amazon are on target - not this time.  This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:<br />1. The night light is way too bright.<br />2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!!  Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me.  It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.<br /><br />I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).<br /><br />Good luck shopping!
Not the best hair drier I've used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but I wouldn't have purchased it if I was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn't really do that.
I really like this blow dryer (dried very quickly and felt that my hair was healthier than with my old blow dryer) but broke after 4 months of use.
It could have been better for the price. It keeps burning my hair occasionally, a problem I never had with the previous dryers. I dont like it for that reason but otherwise it is fine. I bought a different dryer for primary use now. This is just for emergency use.
I was excited about getting this dryer after reading the reviews.  Ive been a hairdresser for 12 years so unfortunally i have carpal tunnel.  This blowdryer is heavier than it says and it is very loud.  At home use would be ok but in salon use....not so much.  I actually returned this dryer to amazon.
Initial review:  This hair dryer is perfect.  It was extremely inexpensive.  It's powerful.  It has multiple settings.  It has a cool shot.  It is quiet.  Perfect!<br />On second though, however:  the operating buttons are awkwardly placed.  While trying to dry your hair, your finger will inadvertently keep turning the blower OFF.  Extremely poor design.
We had this hair dryer for two years.  It was for my boys to use, so all they  needed was a simple dryer.  They usually wound up using my nicer hair dryer as they just didn't like this one.  After two years of limited use, it just started smoking one day and we had to throw it away.
I bought this hair dryer having read the wonderful reviews.  It took forever to come and then didn't live up to expectation.  I was hoping to solve my frizz problem and speed up the drying time, but I didn't think this hair dryer did either.  I sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me $64 of the $88 I spent on it.  They charged me a restocking fee and a shipping fee when I already paid $11 to send it back myself.  All in all, a lousy deal.
I am getting the funny smell on high as others have described. In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.<br />The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch. The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed.
I always buy dryers with a diffuser because of my big curly hair.  But this one is a small bowl shaped diffuser and when I bring it up to dry my hair if blows it out and all over the place.  It has these long holes on the side and the air blows straight through and causes my hair to blow all over the place.  I have to admit I did like it because of the color and that's why I purchased it; not to forget that Conair is a good product.  But if you are using it for the diffuser I'd skip this one.
I purchased this based on a write up in Prevention Magazine.  Yes, a great dryer with lots of shine BUT the locations of the control button stink!  I spend more time reselecting the temperature/speed/on & off, as no matter how you hold this dryer, you are pressing a switch.  I would recommend this to NO ONE!  It's just poorly designed!
I hardly post any reviews but this product forced me to place one. The packaging was not in order. The attachments of the dryer were left opened in the box. It seems to me that the product is used before as there were signs of use. I never expect open box shipments from Amazon but this is an exception. The product is in working condition so I don't want to enter into the hassles of returns. I will keep the product but not satisfied with the Shipping and handling.
I was surprised by how heavy and unwieldy this cheery yellow bird is.  I've been spoiled by lighter dryers and find my arms feeling weary and unwilling to spend time styling.  Not Conair's fault, it was my bad for thinking it would be lighter than it looks.  It's getting shoved to the back of a junk drawer.  Rats.
I've been using Conair hair-dryers for 20+ years. I stuck to this brand because they've always provided good merchandise that was a good value for the money. That long streak ended with this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. several different speed & heat settings provide a useful array of options<br />2. fairly inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. there are two back filter screens; the outer one will not stay attached to the unit on the clip side, & the closing latch is defective; I removed it entirely because it doesn't seem to affect the operation of the unit considering that the second screen is built-in & usable<br />2. the hottest setting is not very hot<br />3. the slide controls are not aligned well (they slip past the detents & require too much force to push)<br />4. overall cheap construction, even for this fairly low price.<br /><br />All of this results in a poorly made unit, & not at all worth the price. A big disappointment for a dedicated Conair user. Time for me to look for another brand.
The dryer does not look very sturdy (inferior plastic) also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting.
having owned a couple of the predecessors of this dryer, which were always quite satisfactory, I find this newly designed mounting system to be a poor excuse for a mounting bracket.  The screws meant to hold the dryer to the bracket are totally inadequate..too small to withstand the torsion of removing and replacing the dryer on the bracket.  I can't imagine how much was saved by changing to this style, but it certainly leaves a bad taste for the overall quality of the dryer.
I bought this Conair hair dryer to replace my old Conair, which I had for 4+ years. Unfortunately, it looks like the quality of Conair's products has gone downhill since my previous purchase. This hair dryer has a Comfort Touch coating, which I initially thought was very nice. It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight. So if you don't mind your hair dryer looking like it's constantly recovering from a bad sunburn after a month of use, perhaps you'll like it.
As others have written the night lights are worthless and stop working after about 2 days.  Unfortunetly I bought them because of the lights and thought they would look high end in my barbershop but instead made my shop look bad when I mounted them and one after another the lights started blowing out.  another issue is that I have personaly noticed is that the breaker triggers quite often if I use another item off the other socket.  Definetly, definetly not worth the price tag at all.  You can buy other blowers without the light for way way cheaper so your really paying for the extra light feature which doesnt work anyway.
product works fair on thin hair but on denser & curly hair takes an excessive time -would not reccomend for travel or heavy & thick hair. My last revlon was more compact-dried faster-easier for the children to use before school.
I received this product hoping to cut my drying time, but that wasn't the case. I'm not sure if the product I received is defective but I have thin hair and it didn't help my dry time. It also makes my hair lay really flat and somewhate oily, making my hair look dirty and thin. I'm not a fan of this dryer but it may be better for people with thick hair.
The one good thing about this hair dryer is that it is quiet.  Other than that, it is no better than my $15, ten year-old Conair.  The Elchim did not dry my hair any faster and my hair is less frizzy when I let my hair air dry.  I wanted a high-end hair dryer and was disappointed.  I didn't find the Elchim to be worth the price.
This hair dryer/styler is heavy and oxy to hold on to.  Buttons are in a position so that you turn it off when drying hair. Makes hair very dull, big and fly-away. Definitely will not recommend!!
This hairdryer worked as advertised for about 10 months.   After that point, the fan stopped working and it got really hot and overheated in about a second.  We'll see how good the customer service is.
After reading positive reviews, I orderd this hairdyer.  I had a Braun hairdryer that worked like a charm for almost a decade which now needs replacement. I dont want an Ionic Hair Dryer since it leaves my thick hair flat.    I was disappointed as soon as I took this out of the box, it's heavier than the Braun I had (too bad they dont sell any hair dryers in the US anymore) and the shape was kind of long.  When I turned it on, I found the dryer even in the lowest setting to be deafeningly loud and the air speed wasn't very good. You have to put it on medium of high to even get the temperature to be very warm but the noise was unbearably loud for me.   I'm hoping I havea defective dryer and I'm looking forward to trying the replacement Amazon agreed to send me.
This hairdryer is lightweight, powerful and quiet as promised, however it completely died after less than a month. It seems like other reviewers had similar experiences. Therefore I would not recommend the product.
My wife has had Conair hair dryers in the past that have lasted many years. Old one finally died. Wanted the same pistol grip style so bought the Blackbird Pro, thinking it would last even longer. This one only lasted 19 months before the bearings went out and I am told by Conair it only has a 12 month warranty. Paid $30 for it, but was able to buy a different cheaper model at WalMart for $17 with a 24 month warranty. Go figure.
I've been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong.  Even with the diffuser on, my hair frizzes every time.  It doesn't dry my hair as fast as I expected it to either.  I also don't really like that the controls are on the back of the handle.  I end up changing the settings without knowing it.  I was using a T3 tourmaline dryer and loved it, but I thought I'd try something different this time.  I'll be going back to the T3 because it's better in every way.  I'm giving the FHI to my niece who straightens her hair.  I'm sure it would be great for her.
This WAS a great hair dryer for a couple of months. I received the dryer in May and used it regularly for several months. In August I noticed that it just didn't feel hot any more. I pushed all the switches and button up and down, in and out several times to see if something was stuck but no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.  I immediately contacted Andis via email and asked what I should do about the malfunctioning dryer but as of now, 3 weeks later, no response from Andis. Bummer!
We had the dryer for a very short time when the switch would no longer work. It is almost impossible to take apart to repair because of the odd screws, holding it together. We are totally disappointed and just now ordered another brand through Amazon. Hopefully, this one will not be disappointing.
I'm not a hair dryer connoisseur, and I have 100% curly hair and just wanted it to dry my hair before I flat iron it occasionally but it kinda leaves my hair frizzy and not smooth like it says ~ I can only compare it to my roommates Conair hair dryer that I seemed to get a better result with.
I bought it in Nov. of 2010 and it expired in July of 2011. I have had goldfish live longer. I was using it and it suddenly started smelling like burning rubber. I immediately turned it off. Now only the low setting works.I have very short hair and it was not used daily. Hmm.....
I rarely write reviews, but I wanted to warn others of my experience which seems to be very common with this hair dryer.  There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought.
The product works but I was disappointed in it.  Speedstick deodorant works just as good when applying a tattoo stencil and is extremely cheaper.
I have tried several of the 100% pure lotions.  One common theme is that they all have a pretty strong scent.  This vanilla scent to me was completely overpowering.  Very, very strong - too much so though.<br /><br />As far as the lotion, it really is one of the few that is totally pure.  I love that.  But the lotion itself for me doesn't work as well as others.  It's fairly runny, and doesn't moisturize my skin very well.  I will not be purchasing this brand anymore because of that.
product is nothing special, especially since most kids shampoos are tear free I was disappointed to find that it burned my 6 month old sons eyes.  Boo hoo.  Will not purchase again
The picture shows an 8 oz bottle and 5 oz toothpaste. At that size it'd be a good deal. What you actually receive is a 3.4 oz bottle and a teeny-tiny bottle of toothpaste. (lost it on vacation, so can't post actual size.) The actual product is good, but don't buy this version of it.
The dryer was great for about 3 weeks.  It was easy to install and had tons of power.  It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and was extremely light weight, however, it DIED!  I was drying my hair and it looked like something was on fire inside and about 30 seconds later it shot a streak of fire out and quit.  The heat source still works but the motor won't.  I am really disappointed with this purchase.
We bought this hair dryer in Oct. of 2009 and it stopped working in May of 2011, up to that point it had worked OK.  It is small and loud and did not dry as well as a normal size hair dryer.  We would not buy this product again.
I have super long fine hair and this didn't do it for me. It actually made my hair feel sticky, for lack of a better word. It is much louder than any other dryer I've used and it didn't come with the concentrator as advertised... I'll be sending it back.
OK, beautiful color, stylish, not heavy seems long lasting probably a good dryer for the right person.  Unfortunately I will have to return it.  This dryer takes a very long time to dry the  hair, it is not hot or powerful enough this should be best for fine hair.  it is kind of uncomfortable to hold as well,  I feel sad since I have to return it but it is not right for me, Love the pink color but what can you do?
I have combination skin which has become more dry this winter so I was looking for extra moisture.  I did not like this moisturizer.  I found it to be too fragrant and left my skin feeling more dry.  I also felt that it left an uncomfortable residue on my face.  I really like facial products that feel clean and natural. This did not for me.
I've used hard hood hair dryers since the 1960s.  This Hot Tools Pro 1061 is so light weight and cheaply made it hardly stays on the table.  The only two settings are HIGH (which almost burns your scalp) and LOW (which takes way too long to dry your hair).  Also it's very difficult to dry the lower back of the hair.  I feel it's disappointing.
I loved it...while it worked.  It lasted about six months before it just ... died.  First it quit working on high and then it quit working all together.  I really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space so I'll be looking for a new one. It simply won't be another one of these.
I purchased this as a Christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person I purchased it for said, well, I loved it until I used it the third time and when I went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart. I guess we'll see how highly rated this seller really is. He hasn't responded to my email still!
The description is misleading relative to heat/air settings. There are 2 air speeds and 2 heat settings plus a no heat button vs. 3 air/heat settings. The air speed, and not much of it, is the same on high and medium; the heat changes. On low, the heat is the same as medium but the air flow decreases.    I have medium-long hair and was looking for a dryer with three distinct settings. This doesn't have them. My old and working Conair has only two settings and is more effective than this. At 1875 watts, the air flow on this is sad. Perhaps that's intentional and I just fail to understand why high isn't very high. The cool air button on the back is marginally inconvenient. Regardless, here's one to avoid and I'm going to try to return the one I got.
I bought this hairdryer as an extra but for an 1875 watt blowdryer this hairdryer is weak!! The medium and high settings blow equivalent air. Maybe I just got a defective one. I have a conair one that is much better.
the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use  (has done this with 3 different dryers), i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product
This hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason.  When it did work, it dried my hair (thick & wavy) in about 5 minutes!  I also loved the retractable cord.  When unfolded, this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which I liked about it.  However, it won't turn on less than 1 year after I got it.  I have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems.  This is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted.  I am giving it two stars because it didn't last.  (while it worked, I'd give it a 5)
I ordered the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer (Color May Vary) expecting a product somewhat looking as described--perhaps in different shades of red and black. The hair dryer came in black which I did not like. It was returned and the return hair dryer was also black. Since color coordination is an important factor in our tiny bathroom I was really disappointed with the product. I returned both packages and will purchase another red hair dryer. I thought the color description was misleading. I have not tried the product so I do not know about its quality.
**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star). It's going back.ially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.

aT FIRST THEY WERE VERY GOOD BUT NOW THEY DON'T  LAST VERY LONG BEFORE THEY BURN OUT. REPLACEMENTS ARE SENT BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENS, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT THIS POINT.
After few minutes on , shut off , and it seen not to blow enough hot air to dry the hair. And, the attachments are not good quality.
the heat stopped working after a few months from buying it. I have long and thick hair, and the blow dryer dried my hair in 20 minutes ... smooth with no frizz. I loved it. I didn't even need to use the straightener. Before the Andis 1875, I was using a cheap blow dryer, and it lasted a lot longer than the Andis, and I washed my hair every other day.  After I bought the Andis, I was washing my hair every 3rd day, and it crapped out on me after a few months. I would not recommend buying this blow dryer. :-(
It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died. When working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed.
Bought this hair dryer for our trip to Italy.  Perfect traveling size, but when using the 250 voltage setting - only the high speed worked.  It got way too hot on that setting to use comfortably.  I ended up not being able to use it because it burned my skin and blew my hair too hard to style it.  I started washing my hair at night and letting it air dry.  The low and high settings work fine in the states on the other voltage, but it was a waste to buy it specifically for the dual voltage piece and then not be able to use it anyway.
Still can't get a handle on this product............can't seem to get it to hold standing position on a counter top...............holds great on a mirror.
Doesn't get hot enough to style my hair.  It dries it, and leaves it frizz free, but it just doesn't get hot enough to shorten my drying time or omit the need for straightening iron.  It is nicely designed and really light weight, but it just didn't do the job.  I'm returning mine.
I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I'm reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.
This product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair. I bought it and I am dissappointed with as its so slow. I thought since I was paying so much it would be quicker & better. I don't personally like it that much. You need to have a lot of time and patience - and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer.
I was really excited about this product as i am a firm believer in the benefits of tea tree oil. The scent was mild and to my liking. However the effects wore off in a few hours- a much shorter time than my fragrance-free crystal deoderant which contains only natural mineral salts. While at work i could actually smell myself-to the point of embarrassment as i felt sure that others were also smelling me! This from some-one with a naturally mild body odor and body chemistry. I tried  it  at least 3 times,  hoping that I was mistaken but the same thing happened every time. Since it came in a packet of 4, I gave them to my husband. it seems to be working a bit better for him, but the effects are still for a fairly short duration. If you have a shower every 4-5 hours or so though, this product may be the perfect one to get.
I stepped to level 9, after using level 6 for about eight months. Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable. However, my skin became so red and irritated and my usually oily skin began to dry out. The results I did see were not worth the side effects and were not worth the money. Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out this is what was most likely making my skin dry. There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products.
These flower-shaped toe separators are super cute and they work fine to separate your toes to polish but when you take them off, the flowers easily rip off making them good for one use.  I'll have to sacrifice esthetics and go with the plain old separators next time.
Looks great and presented excellent...  But- This Item must be turned off completely after each use near where  the unit was installed at the rear of the toliet near the floor!!   You and or your guests have to remember this.(Stated in the directions)   In Asia where these are very popular you do not have to turn the unit off after each use.  Mine leaks a little either in the open postion or closed postion while hanging on the wall!!!   I would say to look for a better unit before buying this one- I was very dissappointed in the quality.
I tried these for about three days and found them difficult to tolerate. The bottom strip is especially challenging to get on right, and they make me salivate for the 30 minutes I have them in, and leave goop behind. I have to really motivate myself to use them, and have several times wondered if my teeth aren't already white enough. My dentist recommended them, so they probably do work if you can stick with the regimen. I haven't been able to so far.
This item was no longer available in stores, so I ordered enough to last a year from Amazon seller ABC Wholesale because I liked the product so much. They packaged the items in sets of three in plastic shrinkwrap.  They substituted a different style (Volume Blast), which is in the exact same can except for the name.  I did not notice the substitution until I opened the last 2 shrink wraps.  All six were the substituted item, not the Max Volume item that I had ordered.  Now I'm stuck with 6 cans of hair spray that are a very different item and performance from what I had originally ordered.
This pill box does not hold 50 pills.  Given that vitamins and supplements are of various sizes, this container will not hold more than 10 total.
The reason I chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts, they looked great and useful.  But turned out those cannot be attached.   All three always falled down after ~15 seconds, so no use at all.  This dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast.   Overall, I am very disappointed for the special features. Its design has a major problem, should make it just as the bottle top.    Updates 2/21/11  After 7 months, it is not hot enough, just a little more than warm.  My old travel dryer is even better than this.
I believed the wonderful hype about this dryer. Still, there was one nagging review that said the hair dryer was breaking her hair. I ignored it. I hope you won't.    The dryer seemed to make my hair dull. I could live with that. But I started to watch my hair get frizzy. I have wavy hair, and I live in a dry climate; no reason for frizz. But it wasn't actually frizzy - it was actually all the broken ends frying into frizzle. I finally had to admit that the dryer was the problem and I went back to my nearly broken old dryer from 1995.     It will take a long time before my hair is grown out and the damage gone. Lots of nourishing hair products and lots of time. And I wasted so much money on a dryer that really hurt my hair. Too late for me, but if you haven't bought it yet, don't do it.
I bought this dryer after getting sick of having to share my old one with 5 other family members.  It's neither great nor horrible.<br />It does what it is designed to do - dry hair.  That's about where the positives end.  The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair.  The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry.  I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology.  The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord.  It's nowhere near long enough for my liking.  It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3!  Bottom line: If you need just a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you.
I was optimistic after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I was highly disappointed.  If you don't apply the product several times in heavy coats you don't taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily).  Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism.  And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves.  I started to use a similar nail polish product but did not like the shine and how frequently it needed to be applied but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well.  I suggest the nail polish over this product.
I took this product to my doctor and he said the colon cleanse was the same as a laxative and the acai juice was just a placebo
The wooden sticks on these swabs break frequently.  There is not much cotton on the tip.  The 6 inch version work much better.  [[ASIN:B000GULSL4 COTTON APPLICATORS PURITAN NON STERILE 6'' 100/PKG]]
I dont recommend you to buy these tester ones. Every tester I bought doesnt stay on me long, maybe half an hour, then I dont even feel the fragrance. Dont waste your money on TESTERs...
I have had this shaver going on two years.  The first one completely broke down after a year and Panasonic sent me a replacement - it was refurbished!  I have had that one about 8 months and it is terrible: the place where it shows minutes and other data is so scrambled that it is impossible to read - the shave is rough and no longer close. I just believe this shaver is meant to last no longer than a year and then it goes bad. By the way, this is an authentic review - I live in California and have been a member here for years.
This simply felt like a lighter petroleum jelly and was in a tube. Been using it for a week and notice no difference. Easily wears off in five minutes. CLinique's lip scrub made my lips feel better.
I bought this dryer, but when I recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be . Then when I wanted to returne it they said they will be 15% restucking fee which sounds really sucks. If I did not open to try it how do I know that is work for me or not.I would never ever buy anything frome discount jungle.
bought as Xmas gift for wife, matched the 1600 kw of our previous Andis blow dryer.  But it lacked the blowing power alot. The light was also very bright on the wall mount, had we kept it I was going to remove the light. Did not meet our expectations, so i returned the item to Amazon.
None available.
I've been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn't dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn't dry your hair. I  thought the exessive heat would make your hair  dry in half the time but it doesn't. This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn't mean the motor is about to quit.<br /><br />My old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find. What can you do.
Worked great.  Love the retractable cord.  Then one day, just 10 months after buying it, it just wouldn't turn on.  I had to throw it in the trash.  My last hair dryer lasted years and years.  This sucks.
This hair dryer does leave my hair soft, but it's air flow is much too strong for styling my shoulder-length hair, even on the low setting.  Since air flow control was the primary reason for selecting this particular item, I am disappointed and use the dryer only occasionally.
The on off switch gets in the way of holding the handle and it often turns off while I am using it.
I was expecting more power.  In all fairness, my regular home-use hairdryers are larger, very powerful and much more expensive models.  I wanted something lighter and dual voltage.  This did not work for me and I returned it immediately for a refund.
Lost the low heat setting in the first couple months.  It caught on fire before it was a year old.  Wouldn't recommend
I liked this dryer at first, but within six months it stopped working.  It had a burning smell inside.  Dead.  I don't know about you, but I feel like a blow dryer should last longer than that.  And, who likes getting stuck without one??
I bought this 5 months ago, and it croaked. Just like that,it starting to smell burned (w/o smoke) and then it stopped. It wasn't the socket, it was the dryer.  Too bad--it was a good price and it when it worked, it worked well. The best part about it was the retractable cord....next!  Go for a brand name like Conair or Sasson.  Their dryers last.
I bought this a little over a year ago, used it 5 to 6 times a week to dry my short hair, and kept the dust/lint trap clean regularly. Loved this dryer and it dried my hair quickly. However, after barely a year, suddenly it blew nothing hotter than luke-warm air. I put up with this for a couple of weeks until one day it blew only cold air. Very disappointing, as I'd really liked everything else about this dryer. It's now been replaced with a lesser but more dependable brand until I can find something comparable. Look elsewhere or expect a limited product lifespan.
bought it. didn't use it. wanted a silver one. picture looks silver. returned it. will get exactly what i want instead.
Pros: Many attachments, price is good, attractive, dries quickly, no damage.    Cons: So heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros.  The weight is also unbalanced, so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out, you wind up hitting buttons.  The attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream (especially the diffuser).  Not recommended.  You can do better.
Just purchased this a few months ago but didn't start using it until a few weeks ago.  It's only blowing cool air now, hard to believe it's a salon dryer. While it worked, it worked well but I can't return it now and it wasn't worth what I paid for it.
Installation is fairly easy.  The convenience of having the dryer on the wall, along with the cord management, was as hoped for.  However, it failed after a year, with smoke and burning plastic odor. The failure occurred in the wall mount area. Given the nature of the failure, I can't recommend this dryer.<br /><br />If you need the convenience, I'd recommend just buying a regular hair dryer along with a nice universal wall mount.  I've noticed that many hotels no longer have wall mounted hair dryers, probably to help save on similar maintenance issues.
I really liked the ionic technology.  It dries hair a lot faster.  However, after a year of owning this, it broke. I had to buy another dryer from Amazon, and I chose a different one--the Conair 213x Infiniti Professional Tourmaline dryer.  I noticed that the sound on the Conair (when on high setting) was a lot quieter than the Andis.  I get the impression that the motor on the Conair is of a higher quality than that of the Andis.
I don't know if my product is defective, I just got it in the mail.  But it is not what I would call a hair dryer.  It doesn't generate much of a wind and it doesn't get very warm.  I would not even consider this something worthy of packing to go on a trip.  I'm going to send it back and keep my nice hair dryer which is just a little bit bigger.
We have a home full of blow dryers, every bathroom has one and we keep our travel bags stocked with them as well.  This one performs as well as any of the other low cost models we've owned but it died 8 months into our use.
hair dryer worked good for about 1 year. Then the switch broke, fused in the open position.I would not buy an Andis product again.
I gave this hair dryer to my wife in mid-April for her birthday.  She loved it.  It got VERY hot and dried her hair in about 10 minutes, which was a whole 10 minutes less than any other dryer she had used.  Everything was peachy until about a month ago (September) when all of a sudden it started making a terrible squeeling noise which required a bang on the counter to get working properly.  The constant banging lasted for about a month and now it squeels and doesn't get hot anymore.  All said and done, this is a great dryer if you only want it for 4 months, but for this kind of money I would have expected it to last a lot longer!
The on/off switch on this dryer needs improvement. I find myself turning the dryer off constantly while using it.
