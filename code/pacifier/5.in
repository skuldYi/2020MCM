Works great!
Love this dryer!
styling hair in style
Excellent dryer.
Perfect
I really like this hairdryer. I haven't had it very long. But it's working well for me.
Reckon I have had this about a year now, at least 7 months. Works great, I use it 5 days a week, blows hot air, doesnt overheat, isnt to big, came quick, didnt cost much. Get you one, you will like it.
Like this as well as the one I had before.
Very quiet. Bought this to replace my girlfriend's stupid loud blow dryer that woke me up every morning. This thing is much easier on the ears.
Live this hairdryer
Perfect for travel.
thanks
So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom.
After using the same blowdryer for probably 8-10years, I decided to upgrade to a new one. I have very thick (*VERY THICK!*) moderately wavy shoulder length hair. Due to my hair thickness, drying times were typically 30-45minutes. I wish I was joking. This dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes (about 10-12minutes more precisely). I am so thrilled with this dryer!! Can't say enough good things about it! I like the texture of the dryer itself, love the speed of drying and the cord is long enough to actually be able to use it! SCORE!
Works great.  Just wish it had a medium setting.
I blowdry my hair at least 3 times a week and I was using a really, really old, cheap, bulky one to get the job done. This dryer gets the job done a lot better! It's smaller, lighter, more ergonomic if you will, and dries my long, thick hair (not always a good thing!) reasonably quick! Great purchase, as long as it lasts as long as my old ones did :)
Love this, keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out.
Amazing amount of air that comes out of it! My wife and I love it... My waiting time to go out is cut in more than half!! Highly recommended. Feels solid like you are getting your money's worth. Has a nice long cord too..
This item it's been working perfectly fine, I'm glad i ordered!!
It is so hard to find a small blowdryer. I'm very happy with this!
Perfect
Great dryer.
looks exactly as in photo. light weight and works like a charm. would definitely recommend
Small and strong.  Great dryer for travel.  Also has dual voltage.  Glad I bought it!
Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall.
This is the 2nd time I bought this little hair dryer because I like it so much. My first one finally bit the dust after about 3 years. It's very small and lightweight--a plus for the suitcase, but still powerful enough to blow dry my hair fast. I have short hair, and this sweet little dryer is all I need to dry and style my hair--no need for a comb or brush. It's no frills--only 2 speeds--high and low. But it does exactly what I need it to, and it does it fast!
No complaints
I have just used it once, but it worked great. Dried my hair in about 15 minutes.
Powerful, lots of fan settings, cold air button, and best of all, a retractable cord! I like the folding handle for traveling, too.Great product. I can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment!
Very powerful. Dries my hair quickly.
Product is just as described. Super fast delivery
This is a great hair dryer with loads of power.  It feels like a salon dryer.
Cute and stylish
I bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another Walmart bargain. I can tell it's quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster. Nice lightweight unit, ergonomically designed. The cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature.
Bang for the buck very good. Good quality
This dryer is exactly what I wanted very lightweight and does the job
This is the best dryer I have ever used. It isn't all that quiet, and though it's not really heavy, it is bigger than I'm used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used. It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers. The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price. Hoping it holds up over time, and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage.
My wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full, THICK hair!
This is my third Hot Tools bonnet dryer in 25 years. I love it: highly recommend it. I, too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet. The dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings I keep lower it after 10-15 minutes then every five.
Nice quality, fairly quiet, nice looking and not too big.  I bought two.
Very Much Worth It!
Best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time
I love how compact it is and how amazing it works!!!
This is a great dryer for the price. I haven't noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn't very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I've used but it isn't hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other's reviews you'll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I've been using texturing product which also isn't conducive to smooth or shiny hair.
Good experience will order again
Great blow dryer !!!!
Great for the price!! Glad I didn't spend hundreds like I've seen on others!! Love it!!
My purchase of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Ionic Standing Hair Dryer was a great investment. I love the purple and black color. It has two heat settings, high and low. Two speed settings, high and low, and it has an on/off ionic knob. It has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it. It also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house. This is much better that the hooded dryer that I had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so I could fit under the hood. I use my dryer on a weekly basis. The hood is very roomy and has a flip up front. I can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem. Now I can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home.
Best one
This had terrible reviews but it was the only one I could find with the 3 things I wanted: diffuser, retractable cord, and folding handle. I figured for the price it was with a try. I'm so glad I did because I love it! I don't understand the negative reviews. It dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great!
Absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned hands down!!!! I love this dryer so freakin fast it's amazing. Came in less than a weeks time. Very pleased!
So far so good.
Nice quality.
works great ! love it!
This thing is still going almost a year later
The speed and heat settings are wonderful. I don't get that gross feeling like it is burning my hair, or blowing it insanely, like with other blow driers. It is very convenient for storage.
Nice quality.
Works just fine.  No problems.
Excellent  hair dryer
This is one of the best hair dryer you will probably ever find. It is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly. Plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away. In addition, it's relatively small so it's not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase. A win all around.
I love this little hair dryer. I have arthritis and the larger dryers are hard to manipulate. I also have short, thin hair so this little dryer makes it easier to use a roll brush at the same time. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with thicker hair as the heat is not as strong or powerful as an 1875 but it's great for me.
Holy cow...maybe it's because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and I haven't blow dried since (what can I say?  It's hot and I'm too lazy to fancy up in the summer) but WOW this thing works fast.  It's cute, it's small, but it packs a punch!
cool speed is perfect for my hair.  no frizz or dryness
It's good. I like 3 level of heat.
I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.  I didn't think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don't hurt when I blow dry my hair!  Love it!!
Excellent product.
I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it's very affordable. thank you. ðŸ˜Š
I just love it
Love how light it is and how quickly it dries my hair!
WORKS GREAT!! JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!
Traveling abroad?  Most foreign countries use 220 VAC instead of the USA 120 VAC.  This means that if you try your hair dryer overseas it will work for about 1 second and fail.  This unit has a voltage selector switch so it will work no matter what the voltage is.  Folds to much smaller unit, name branded.  Remember to buy the correct country plug adaptor.
Love love love it. Best one yet.
My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  He seems to enjoy it.
I use it on my curly air.  Works great!
Awesome dryer! I was on the fence for a while but now I'm addicted. Leaves my fine, fizzy, dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier. If you are waiting, don't...you just have to try this once and you will be sold!
I just love it!
Great hair dryer!  Love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall.  We have one in each bathroom!
Love this hair dryer.  It's louder than I'm used to but my hair seems smoother.
My wife loves this thing, she said It feels like a real saloon.
LOVE this hair dryer!
Best dryer I have ever owned.
very nice hair dryer and good price too!
Good!
It is everything I expected..
works great
Shipment takes a bit long but very good product
Woks good
conair always makes good products
Great size and has adequate power...
Small, compact, powerful!
The fan speed is stable and fast!<br />3 temperature selection is very useful, neither too cold nor too hot for me with short hair~~<br />Highly reommend!
I just really like this hairdryer.  In fact, I purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer, which I had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out.  It's comfortable to hold, it dries my long, thick hair quickly (no easy feat), and leaves my hair smooth and shiny.  I initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different (more expensive) ionic hairdryer, and didn't get the same results.  So I looked for an exact replacement on Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find it, not to mention at such a good price.  Needless to say, I didn't hesitate to click the &#34;Buy now with 1-Click&#34; button, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Tourmaline Ceramic technology - emits infrared heat and negative ions, which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying<br />Lightweight, comfortable to hold and use<br />Long cord<br />Foldable - packs and stores easily and compactly<br /><br />CONS:<br />Doesn't have separate heat and speed settings<br />The on/off switch is a little difficult to use<br />Doesn't have a retractable cord
I love it this dryer is prefect for my daughters and I .
Great quality.
Love it! Just did not get any papers to register/warrantee on this product.
It's a bit heavy but I LOVE IT! I have curly, frizzy hair and it has helped control it. The price it GREAT too. I can't compare it to a &#34;high end&#34; dryer but within this price range it's #1.
excelente!!!!
Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  I've looked at this one online a few times but couldn't justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It's not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn't buy it for color so I don't care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I'm drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I'm guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn't make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I'm not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I'd have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.
Loved!!! My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes. The best.
I never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it. Cut my drying time in half. I've just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer. Glad I finally wised up!
LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn't break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &#34;4&#34; and &#34;6,&#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I've used at between 7-10. Not dis'ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.<br /><br />My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that's a personal preference. Maybe you'll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.<br /><br />Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars.
I used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much I came home and ordered one.  It works so much faster than my older one.
GOOD !!!!
professional grade in my home!!
Great hair dryer for the price!
Bought this to take on a trip to Europe.  I love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage.  Most importantly, this small dryer works really well!  Great purchase....BUY IT!
This really works.  I've tried several ceramic, ionic dryers in the past few years and I saw absolutely no difference in how my fine ,&#34; prone to frizz in humidity&#34; hair came out after blowing it dry.  With my new Panasonic, my hair looks smoother, less frizzy and stays that way during the day. For me, this is a keeper!
Light and powerful.  Great for travel.  Dries your hair quickly.
Love this dryer!!!! Hair dries quicker and is so convenient to travel with!
Got this for my mom. It is a bit heavier than she'd like but overall she loves it!
Great...exactly what I expected
Quiet, excellent drying, doesn't get dangerously hot.
Really enjoying this dryer. Works really well for my curly hair. I had a really nice/pricey dryer, similar to this one, for years and when it gave out I bought a dept store $30 dryer. I noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy. I used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer. So glad that I did.<br /><br />I mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat. I get great curls and less frizz. On occasion I use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and I love that too. Makes my hair silky smooth.<br /><br />The last time I bathed my dog I used the other nozzle that is supposed to be &#34;quick dry.&#34; That was really amazing. Dried my little dog in no time. I was happy and she seemed to be relieved. I imagine that if you don't need to worry about frizz, this quick dry nozzle would be great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />I've had this for several weeks and I would recommend it. Hoping this one lasts quite a while!
This thing is awesome!! Small, compact, powerful. This thing stores well as it folds up, for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often. Conair has been making quality products for years and they have always been affordable.
I was afraid that this hair dryer would not be top quality because of the price. However, everything about it seems great.
This dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft, has good variety of settings, and that necessary cool shot of air to set my hair for the day. Highly recommend! Can't beat the price point.
Love this! GREAT Power, adjustable speeds, works awesome!
excelente
Best cheap hair dryer ever
Love this blow dryer!
perfect dryer
Great blow dry . shiny hair and fast blow dry
Awesome dryer, I have been looking for something like this for quite sometime!
Sleek, comfortable to hold, works great. So happy that I purchased this item.
Great, lightweight, use every day for past year almost & love it!! Best price too!
Cheap and comfortable, defenetly worth it
amazing dryer !! it makes my hair soft and easy dry. Even though the price is expensive but I really recommend this product to others ! i like pink color very pretty. very useful !!!!
I really do like it! It is so handy and drys my hair very good. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a hair dryer.
Excellent product, and dries my long thick hair very fast.
Works excellent. Light weight also which I like very much.
Bought this as a damaged box item. It was in perfect condition. It is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind it is solid & somewhat heavier than your basic, cheap home brand.
Very good
It gets the job done!
Small light and powerful.  I love this hair dryer.
great blowdryer !! i looked up for reviews before i purchased and i could not be happier! Drys really fast and its very hot!!!
Found this gem in a hotel in Savannah and liked it so much I took a photo and found it on Amazon.  Bought two, one for each bathroom.
Excelente
Awesome
Works great! It's so cute! Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color. It does the job! I have fine hair and this dryer doesn't overpower me or my hair. Nice and lightweight. You might think, oh, this little thing isn't going to do anything, but it DOES! Highly recommended for fine hair.
Worked in Middle East
Love these
Fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it so I am very excited to use mine
Used once - recently cut hair - Sure to use it again after hot weather ends.
I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is powerful, quiet and dries my hair in less time than previous dryers.<br />I have the Elchim for European current and thought it worked so well that I decided to buy one that uses US current.<br />I  highly recommend this Elchim product!
The best hair dryer ever!  We traveled to NYC over the summer.  At the Seton Hotel, these were the hair dryers they had for guests to use.  My hair was not dry.  It had a variety of settings and was not noisy.  I came home immediately an ordered one.  Wen shampoo and this hair dryer word well together.  :)
I like the hair dryer
I have 3B curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing, it doesn't make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots. The dryer is super lightweight and is very quite. I keep it on low and the power is still amazing, it cut my hair routine by half. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 3B curly hair.
Good use. It's very compact. Make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad.
Dryer was delivered on time.  It is powerful, dries my short hair in 2 minutes and isn't heavy.  Love it.
It arrived within 2-3 days and works perfectly. I have thick, frizzy, curly hair and never have been able to blow dry it because it gets so much poofier. However, with the diffuser this blow dryer made my curls shiny and soft, no frizz or poof, I'm in love!
very nice
Hard to find a small, lightweight travel dryer that we use everyday. Works great and very portable when we travel in our RV. Would buy again.
Excelent
Excellent hairdryer, folds up nicely, haven't had the opportunity to test it on 240V yet, but I'm sure it'll do just fine. Turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you're using it with 240V, which is a really user-friendly addition. (You're not suppose to use it on high with 240V according to the manual.)
works great, no need to purchase a hairdryer with a price tag higher than this...
It will seriously dim the lights in your house, but man can it dry hair!
This item is great!<br />Great price and the best thing I like is that I'll be able to use it any where in the world. Thanks much
Bought this for my girlfriend. She loves it!
Dryer works very well for ,me!
Im a dude first off. At first I thought it was real heavy then I got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as I am growing my hair longer. Ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry. When you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down. NOT PICTURED IT COMES WITH A FUNNEL AND THE FUNNEL WITH THE COMB ON BOTH SIDES!!!!!!!!<br />Im 1 for 1<br />Take my advice at your own risk.
Best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned.
This is a sturdy, powerful hair dryer.  My stylist recommended it and it DOES NOT disappoint!!
I really like this product.  It's compact, but powerful, and pretty lightweight.  Does a good job drying my fine hair (I've fine hair, but a lot of it) in scant minutes.  The only thing it isn't, is quiet, but they don't advertise it as such- just pointing it out though.  I'm very pleased with it.
With the exception of colors, this appears to be the same as an earlier model of the same brand I owned.  That was reliable for several years until slowing speed required replacement.
This hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months. I even tried xtava.com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail. I contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so I waited and waited. I didn't want to buy any other hair dryer. I just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200W power and nice design. Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months. But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time. I absolutely do not regret the long wait.
Birthday present for the wife after she used one at a hotel. Drys in half the time and stores easily.
My old one broke down after only about 20 years of hard work. I got a new one and was pleased to find the design was the same. Why get off a winner. Works well and easy to pack.
Works good for me, no problems and I use it damn near everyday
Works great in my cottage up north.<br />Recommended to hotel & motel owners who want a secure way to provide a hairdryer to guests, without losing it.
My girls say this works great.  Much better than their old one.  Dries hair fast!
Love the product. Very fast shipping.
I really like this product. The cord seems to be way longer than what I am used to. I really like the tools it comes with...
Love this dryer! I noticed a big difference after using just once. Hair felt healthier!
Perfect & light weight.
Excellent product! Excellent customer service.
Good
Solidly built hair dryer - diffuser stays on and doesn't pop off on a moment's notice as did a Revlon drier I used to have but which fell apart in less than a year... (am returing to Bed Bath Beyond) nice built in hook for hanging, plenty powerful, not too noisy, price was OK. All in all, works better than a towell and/or shaking the head a lot to remove water!  haha
I love the price
I had this one for over 3 years and it worked great.  It just recently died and I bought the exact same model.  The retractable cord is so nice!
Very good for the hair and face.
Excellent
******update, 3 years and goin strong, good product   Original review -   Been over a year, love this thing, has different heat settings and attachments, is yeah and it's cute to boot
I use this on my dog after I give her a bath. Great
This is the second blower I've owned! I almost went for the newer style...so glad I didn't! I just love this model and I don't think I'll ever look to change! It's a great, reliable blower and the power behind this puppy is awesome! I tend to have frizzy hair, so I need a good blower to smooth it out! This is the perfect choice to remedy this hair type! :-)
excellent product, what I asked was what got me
Great hair dryer. It is less noisy that my other hair dryer. Beautiful finish!!!
really good to use
Fine product wish I had one years ago.
I've been using this for a few months now and I..... love it ^_^ ! Its does a great job, I always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool. Unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button, this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature. The burst of cool air button gets even cooler. Thats what I really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool. Okay enough with the &#34;cool&#34; XD Its a great product, you won't be disappointed.
Love this hair dryer. For years, I had a terrible old dryer that wouldn't die. When it finally did, I was worried that anything new I got would be junky like so many electronics these days. I have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as I did the day I got it. It dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair. It has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too.
My hair dryer broke and I needed a replacement.  I keep my hair dryer plugged in by my sink and I worried about my grandkids accidentally dropping it in the sink so I bought this wall mounted unit.  I absolutely love it.  So convenient and it's more powerful than my old hair dryer.  I may get another one for the other bathroom.
I've had this blow dryer for a year or so and I love it. I haven't had to replace it
I really like this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly & thoroughly, even though just a little heavy. Excellent product & highly recommended
great buy
THIS DRYER IS THE BEST I've used for my very curly hair. I DRY MY HAIR SECTION AT A TIME BY HOLDING THE DRYER CLOSE TO THE SCALP, AND SQUISHING THE HAIR INTO THE DIFFUSER. AFTER ABOUT 6 minutes my hair is completely dry. THEN I MASSAGE MY SCALP BUT I NEVER PUT MY HANDS THROUGH THE ENDS. IT IS CALLED THE PIXIE METHOD OF DRYING. I NEVER HAVE A BAD HAIR DAY ANYMORE.
After my $60+ salon brand hair dryer crapped out on me after like 4 months, I decided to just look for a hair dryer with a great price. I did not even realize that it's a conditioning dryer and now my hair never looked better! My old dryer made my hair look dry and unhealthy and I can't believe how much better it looks now. I love it!! It doesn't get super hot but dries my long thick hair fast and fluffy. I've had it for a little over a year now and it is still working great.
I love it for its practicality and efficiency.  It is quiet all right.
Does what it's supposed to.
Shipment was received in short time.<br />Hair dryers are easy to installed
Exactly what I expected
Love this blow dryer. For those of you who have curly hair and have issues with bigger dyers, this is the one for you!
so easy to install, so sturdy. I love it!
Dries my hair in no time, a really great investment! love it!
Great dryer,  works extremely well,,,,  love the automatic rewind.... works great, just follow the directions.....Very satisfied with this dryer.
Great for the price! Strong and powerful!
Best blow dryer I have ever owned! My 4C hair gets pretty straight using this not even on the high setting!
works great.......light enough to be comfortable.
Working excellence.
Excellent!
No problems with it. Works for me!
Compact, easy to travel with.  Puts out plenty of air.  Works very well.
I bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her (which I end up paying for anyway) so I thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever. She loves this hair dryer, she puts her hair in rollers and sits under. It gets very hot too! Thanks for the great buy!
Thank you
Just a really nice hair dryer for the money.
Used one in a hotel and replaced my huge home dryer.
Does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air.
This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned.
Excellent product. Worked as advertised, powerful and light.
I've had this for a couple years. It's been very good. The cord is a little short. Otherwise, no complaints.
No issues whatsoever!!<br /><br />Completely satisfied with this product!!
Love it very very powerful. And gets hot if you need it to. Cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower. Love the feel of the blower too it doesn't slide out of your hands and it's not very heavy.
Love it. It is very powerful hair dryer. I like it because it also folds up & takes less space
Way better quality than I expected for the price! Love it!!
Exactly what I wanted. Great price. Retracting cord a little hard to get use to. Don't retract it most of the time.
Good quality!
Works great!
Perfect!
Great dryer. Dries quickly, love the different temperature settings. It is a little heavier than I expected, but so far, so good!
Love this blow dryer
works well.  Just as good as a $200.00 unit
good
Great
This one replaced the last Remington that I had (and loved) since 2002! I have very long hair that's color treated, and these types of hair dryers are a life saver.  I hope this one lasts 13 years... added bonus... it matches my purple-accented bathroom.  :)
Bought this for my sister in law and she was very happy
I purchased this because the sidewalks at my workplace are very uneven, and every time it rains we get huge puddles that cannot be avoided. My shoes always get drenched, and I needed a way to quickly and easily dry them. For that purpose, I've found this hair dryer to be very useful and efficient. I also use it to warm my socks in the winter. There's no better feeling than being out in the cold with warm feet.<br /><br />I can't speak to its intended purpose, as I don't have hair and so have not used it to dry my hair. Please don't hold this against me.
muy bueno.
great!!!
Very pleased with this travel hair dryer. Compact and lightweight and works really well.
This is my third one in 15 years.  They are convenient and very reliable.  A great buy!
Great dryer! I have had this for several years and it still works great! Definitely recommend!

This is buy far the best hair dryer ever! I have thick curly hair that usually takes an hour to dry. This hair dryer took less than half the time to get my hair dry
Perhaps it's strange coming from me, but I've purchased 2 of these and it's still my favorite blow dryer!<br />I used this dryer for more than 4 years and never had a problem.<br />I purchased a second one because I gave the first one to my fiance', who lives in Japan!<br />Her mom fell in love with it, didn't bring it to the States so I had to buy yet another ConAir blow dryer :).<br />But now she has my second one, and won't accept the ConAir Infiniti Pro I bought for her.<br />Too bad, because I miss my cordless action :(<br />But I can still blow dry my hair after taking the braids out, because this is by far the best dryer ever.
A great item to have when traveling to Europe because of its dual voltage capability . Easy to use. Convenient to carry.
This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. It provides tons of power and isn't loud. It dries my hair quickly and doesn't hsve shutting off issues like other dryers I have used. The bed head brand seems to be experts in their field and make products that work well and hold up well. They last a long time and I have no complaints.
Does the job at an unbeatable price! I have very thick Romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast. Great product and would buy again if I had to.
More power than expected.
Works great for its intended use, especially for how small it is!
Love this hair dryer!!!  It gets hot enough and blows hard enough to dry your hair quickly!!!!  My teenage girls with long hair love it too!!!!  It also lasts forever!!!!
Powerful yet compact hair dryer. Works really well!
This is the absolute best blow dryer I have ever owned and I have owned many over the last 45 years.
My favorite so far. Takes less time to dry and is quiet. My original one stopped working after about 1 1/2 year, they sent me a replacement right away. I had the new one in 2 days!
Great purchase, great product, very fast shipment- love it
My old Con-Air finally bit the dust. I had been impressed with my hair stylist's hair dryer, but I knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget. However, I was willing to spend a little more than $20 on a drugstore hair dryer that, hopefully, would last a bit longer this time. I have very short, very, very fine hair. When it was longer, I used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy; however, with my current pixie cut, I knew I only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle. Because of the short-length and fineness of my hair, I also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds. A lot of what's available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair. I did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this. The extremely positive reviews left by other Amazon customers gave me confidence I had made a good decision.<br /><br />Happily enough, turns out I was correct! This unit feels solid. It is well-constructed, and doesn't have the &#34;hot spots&#34; like my old Con-Air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere. It is a touch heavier than my old dryer, but I like the way it feels in my hand. The bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use. It is also powerful! The motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any I've used previously, causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly. Paradoxically, this unit performs much better than any 1875 W hair dryer I've ever used, and yet it is much, much quieter, and range of airflows gives it finesse. It comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings, and I have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs. If you use the highest temperature setting, it will get hot! So if you need the high temp and high power, it is definitely there for you. It also comes with a concentrator nozzle, the output width of which in my opinion, is the perfect length. Some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide, which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair. But the output width of this nozzle is only around 2&#34;, perfect for a shortie like me.<br /><br />What more can I say? I am extremely happy with this purchase. It does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s/early 90s, which I just found to be humorous. It is very no-muss, no-fuss, and I don't even think mine had packaged instructions with it. But it works just as well as my stylist's professional dryer and at a terrific price point. I would buy again in a heartbeat (but hopefully I won't have to, at least for a long, long time).
I have long hair so it used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair completely. Now i can get it dry in less than 5 minutes! It's also useful to know that when you have it on the low/medium speed, it's uber quiet. I can blow dry my hair at night without having to worry about waking my family members. Definitely worth the money.
Works great.  This brand was in our resort in Florida and my husband just had to have his own!
Strong blow ; great design ; it has a bit of a weight to it but its great ! ;; i got no diffuser but i got a concentrator attachment
nice
The hair dryer is stylish and does a fine job with hair drying.  I like the hook on the side that keeps the cord in place.
best blow dryer for price
Love it!  Quiet and powerful, cord retracts well.
Amazing blow dryer! Worth every penny! I have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer gets it almost totally straight! Amazing power and heat! Product just like expected and shipping was fast for the free option. Got it in about a week!
love it
So far I love this hair dryer. I was bummed that my old Conair died after 10 years. Yes you read that right. 10 years!! I loved that hair dryer and I loved how quickly it dried my hair. The new dryer works well so far. It has different speeds and heat levels on two different controls which I really like. The cold air button works great. I really have no complaints.
I'm a professional hairdresser and unusual buy chi  which are 3 times the cost of this at first I bought 1 to see how I liked it. .I LOVED THIS DRYER needless to say I bought another. been extremely  happy with it..
Amazing hair dryer!
This is a great dryer for the price.
OMG I love this blow dryer.  I just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one and I can see a huge improvement in my hair.  It dries quickly and stores nicely.  Love this!
No complaints. She loves it. &#34;I used to hate drying my hair but now I actually enjoys it&#34;. &#60;-----Actual girlfriend quote<br /><br />Draws A LOT of power. Tripped the breaker in our old house. Not so anymore.
I have bought this same or very similar dryer for each of my last three houses. I love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink. It works well and for the money I think they are of pretty good quality.
Works great not very loud, it's hot which is fine with me!
Best blow dry that I have ever owned.  Worth the money.  Cord never gets tied up
This is my absolute favorite hairdryer! I have been using it for probably 10 years! When I moved out after college, I bought one for my apartment since my mom wanted to keep hers! Haha. It works amazing. I adore the diffuser attachment! Best one I've ever used.
I owned this hair dryer for about five years and used it nearly daily. It finally started making a weird noise so I replaced it with the exact same model. A five year life span for such an inexpensive hair dryer exceeded my expectations.
This blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did. My hair is really curly and I like it better straight and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort. It has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place. I don't have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush. If you have frizzy hair this is the blow dryer for you
Mom's love it
Nice and compact with lots of drying power. Also not as loud as some other hair driers.
great
good
Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out. Love it.
The ideal hair dryer, small yet powerful.
Great dryer.
Works great cools itself Down would buy again
My first hairdryer, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it works great for me.
Great air pressure
Great dryer. It is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.
like it, very durable. it won't dry your hair really quickly but that is good for your hair.
I like this hair dryer and can't believe the price for such a great quality dryer.  Highly recommend.  Way better than anything at Walmart or Target.
Love it
Have had it for 8 months, works great. Don't know how it does it, but it dries my hair 3 times faster and with less heat than my old hairdryer. Not disappointed.
very good
So far so good.  Dries my hair without any frizz, is lightweight and not noisy.  Comes with a nice 4 year warranty.
I bought Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer almost a years ago (02 August 2014), and it is a great hair dryer - definitely a 5 stars.<br /><br />Both I and my husband (and occasionally our dog) have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis - we're among those people who always dry their hair - and it still works perfectly.<br />I am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer: I like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly, but I also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair. The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!
Amazon here says I've been using this since September of 2011. Wow. Well, I still love it, has all the low to high, hot to cool options I need. I have no complaints about this and I would definitely buy it again if something were to happen to it.<br />Great purchase.<br />:)
It works very well and I use it everyday!
Love this dryer. I bought one for my daughter because she wanted mine!
I love everything about this hairdryer - it is smaller, quieter, hangs on the wall and I just plain LOVE IT!
Beat blow dryer! My husband purchased one for me at Ukta for $80. It had a short in it and blew up. I purchased this one off Amazon. I have crazy thick hair. It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry. This cuts the time down in half. It is on the heavy side and the buttons are in a horrible place, buy I love it!
Love this hair dryer becuse its small and powerful!
Excellent product. We purchased this blow dryer in 2009 and it is still going strong.
Great!
I love conair products. I never had any issue with Conair Products in past and I will keep on buying it in future. I bought this one for my mom because of its size. Its small, light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose. My mom loved the size and color. The noise from the dryer is not loud.
Powerful little dryer, and I love the small size, it fits well in my tiny bathroom.
Love it!! Drys hair fast!! No frizz!!
Great product!
First used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it. My own hairdryer finally gave out so I had the opportunity to buy this, very happy with it. Retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one, and I feel like I have less frizz after drying my hair with this one, probably because it has the diffuser at the end. Even on the highest setting it's not too hot.
Love it
I was skeptical because it was so small but this baby packs a punch.  My hair is past the halfway point of my back. I have long thick hair and it is ombred (bleached). Sometimes chemically treated hair takes forever to dry but this thing does the job as if it's a regular sized hair dryer. Definitely a plus. If it breaks, you'll bet I'll just buy another without complaint.
Great product and super fast delivery.
I love the hair dryer.  It's small enough, not heavy or cumbersome so that it wont aggravate my carpal tunnel syndrome.
Very cool
REALLY GREAT GETS VERY HOT
This hair dryer is by far the best one that I have ever owned! The price was definitely right! I love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that I have owned! It has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air. It dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when I dry it with other hair dryers. I would definitely recommend this to others!
bought this to replace the exact same model for my wife that was 10 years old... it's a good product... works really good and easy to store...
Just wht I was looking for. Great product.
i love it
One of the best!
I love this! Not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when I'm in a hurry, but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places! There's a bit of frizz but it's not bad compared to what I've experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer. Amazing product for a curly haired girl!
This is my second one as the first one got a short in it.  I love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way.  It helps keep my bathroom organized
I've had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and I absolutely love it. It's blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers (think hurricane vs gentle breeze). Of course, you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast, this dryer will not disappoint. It also heats up quickly, cools down quickly, comes with several attachments, and has a long cord. The only downside is that I don't like where the buttons are because the way I hold it to dry my hair, many times, I accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to. I would buy this a thousand times over.
Great dryer. We like it very much.
I waited until I used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review.  I have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week.  So far this hair drying has held up very well.  It's light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous Revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use.  I don't use the diffuser because it doesn't do a thing for my board straight hair.  For the money this is an excellent dryer.
I really like this dryer.  Not sure why complaints about the cord - directions say to hold the plug.  If you don't hold the plug of course it's gonna snap back and hit you.  As for the noise.  Yes, it is noisy but you are using it for a short time and it is just as noisy as any other hair dryer.  And it is not too heavy.  I think it dries my hair fast and arm does not get tired.  All in all, I would recommend this dryer.  I love that it is pink, the cord retracts and takes up little space for storage.
Dries hair quickly without getting too hot.
Works fine--- couldn't be better
Drys my thick hair fast!!
My wife loves it!!!
Our clients love it. It has a quality look to it.
Great hair dryer, just the right speed and temperature to do your hair. Best hair dryer I have owned, beats out the dryers I have paid almost $200 for.
Great
Love it
I bought this for a friend as a gift she  loves it she has her own shop .
The best
Does the job for a great price :)
I love my new blow dryer. It does not dry out my hair. perfect. Thanks
Works great. Good price. Just as described
So far works great!
Love this dryer. Great feature at a great price
Good item !
Excellent product. Small but very powerful.
great buy
Great
This hair dryer is very powerful and dries quickly.
Well worth the money! I'm growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny! I should have discovered this earlier!
Reliable, reasonably loud, and lasts long. I used Conair before and those malfunction super easily.
I love this hair dryer.  Using the attached comb makes it very easy to dry my hair. Two thumbs up.
The only problem with this dryer is that the long metal pole connecting to the hood. The round piece around the metal pole is cracked!!!  Trying to figure out how I can find a better solution then this plastic piece around the metal pole.
This Conair hair dryer works great. It runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer (an old Remington). The cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished. I recommend this item.
Amazing! Absolutely love this blow dryer. Very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney!
good
Love it. Highly recommend it.
I LOVE this hair dryer!!!! I can't remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it. I am so glad I spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally. I can't believe how great my hair looks after just one use! I will update my review if necessary, but if my results continue it won't be necessary! Highly recommend this awesome dryer!!
Nice hair dryer, mounted on the wall, clearing counter space and easily acceptable.  Varied during speed....great little hairdryer.
Quality hair dryer still working years later.  Because of the rounded edges, it does not sit on a flat surface well and mine has fallen and gotten chipped over the years but it still works.
Exactly what was described is exactly what I needed! Working great!
I have long and thick hair,usually take me over and hour to dry my hair but with this hairdryer it only take me 30 minutes.
This is a great blowdryer to take traveling. Has full power in a compact size. Handle folds up nicely. Used it in France wth an adapter.
Great for travel with lots of power and heat.
My first one lasted 20 years. I ordered this to replace it.
Works great, easy to use. Lightweight and not too noisy compared to others. The included attachments are great.
I love this blowdryer!! It has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine. Comes with all standard attachments and I think would be great for any type of hair. Excellent quality for the price. I have had mine for over a year now and it still works like it is brand new!
Love it.  I ordered two.  Works great, small, lightweight, easy to handle.  Like the long cord and the cool shot button.
Product excelent. Arrive in condiction good. Thanks
Works better than my more expensive dryers.
I love this hair dryer! Used it today and it was amazing. I have thick hair and it dried it so quickly! And I used no products today and my hair is so so silky!!! Normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and I use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end. This was amazing!! Great Dryer and a long cord too!! Love it!!!!
Powerful and easy to pack on domestic trip.  :)
Very pleased.  Folds nicely, cord retracts well.
This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price. It was easy to put on the wall.
I love this hair dryer.  I like that it dries my hair super-fast and it is super-light to hold.  The curved handle makes it easy to hold.  Great price, too!
Love it!  So convenient.
Great product! Ordered and choose two day shipping and it arrived in one day. Used this product same day and got excellent results with a protein treatment I was doing.
good product ..! Recommended
Nice weight and power!
Best hair dryer I've ever owned. I have really thick hair so I needed a professional grade dryer. It drugs my hair very quickly.
It blows.  Hot.  Really well.  Amazing stamina.  Plug it in and it never stops.  Not expensive.
Best hair dryer ever!  Quite heavy if that is an issue.  I love it.
Love it, very convenient. I was thrilled when I got a hotel room and they had this hair dryer in the bathroom. I was very excited when I saw it available on Amazon. I really didn't think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as I figured there's was a commercial grade. I was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well. I get a lot of compliments on it when I have guests, especially those that forgot to pack one or don't want to go digging for their. It is an excellent idea for bathrooms or teenagers room. My Granddaughter has asked for one to put beside her vanity. Perhaps Santa will provide.
I purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores.  I have only been using it for about two weeks, and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far.  The size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag, taking up much less room that my defunct dryer.  A bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance.  I anticipated a loud, high pitched scream, due to the compact size, but it operates with quiet efficiency.  I have short hair, and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability.
Such a great travel hairdryer. Also works internationally and is a great size.
I guess I've always been using sub-par hair dryers, this one blows them out of the water (pun very much intended)<br /><br />Thank you to everyone else who posted a great review, this is a great one to buy and I'm glad I came here to read reviews before I purchased.  It's pretty, very powerful, and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so I'm constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off :)<br /><br />10/10
Lots of power and easy to use.  Fit well near my vanity mirror.  Very pleased.
Super fast drying
Love it!!! Drys hair quickly!
great product.  This is the second one I have bought, to give to my niece as a birthday gift since we love ours so much.
Compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and/or longer trips.
This hairdryer exceeded my expectations.  Although it's a bit on the heavy side, its compact frame and powerful air flow fully compensate that one drawback.  One of the best hairdryers I have owned.
buenisimo
Love hair dryer. Wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago!  Why did they shorten cord??
I purchased this to use on a trip to England and Ireland. I was VERY happy with it! It is very small, lightweight, and high powered. I wouldn't want to use to all the time, but I'm very happy with it for travel.
So happy I finally bought this dryer for my bathroom.  It has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed.
I have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me.  It's a little loud but worth it!
This is a replacement for the one I have had for many years.
Fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type. Great settings lots of power! Hangs out of the way yet right there when you need it!
This is the best dyer I have ever used!!!! I have frizzy curly hair and when I use this dyer my hair comes out smooth and straight...
great dryer and delivered in just three days
Compact and powerful.
Love the built in nightlight
love this dryer.  it's quiet but powerful, and the 'cold' button really works without losing power! (unlike the last dryer I had). other reviewers mentioned it's weight, and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers, but it's not a problem for me, sorta feels like it's more industrial and not cheap.  the outside texture of the dryer is nice too.  overall I think it was a great buy!
Works great!  Love the retractable cord!!  It does go back in fast so I hang on the the plug (lightly) until its retracted so the plug doesn't swing around and hit something.
This is my second one. The first one has been  broken while moving home. I would say it is a product worth its price. Great deal.
I don't write many reviews; but this hair dryer is the absolute best that I have ever owned and very reasonably priced.  I live in humid south Florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz.  I have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush; however, after a stint in the Florida heat I am all frizz again.  I decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one.  I do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over $50 which just seems like too much to me.  The Remington AC9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all -- IT WORKS.  I can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft, smooth, shiny, frizz-free hair that stays frizz free even when I am outdoors.  I have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer, but like I said,  my hair is only shoulder length. If you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity,  buy this dryer.  You will not regret it.
Pretty good for a home device
I bought this hair dryer at Target several years ago, and was SOOO impressed with the power, that I would randomly talk to people about my new hair dryer!!  I had long hair at the time, and it cut drying time down significantly.  Also left my waivy hair perfectly straight and silky smooth.<br /><br />I do think after a few years, the Ion starts to lose effectiveness (on all hair dryers I've ever had).  I had it for at least 4 years, before the back filter broke, and then my hair started getting sucked into the back.<br /><br />So I tried several different dryers, even expensive name brand ones like Babyliss, none that I really LOVED like this one.  I recently chopped my hair off, and am using a less powerful dryer.  But after realizing my love for this dryer, I went ahead and bought a second one, and have it put up in my closet, to use again once my hair grows back out, and I need that 'power' to straighten and dry quickly<br /><br />Only CON is that is IS a bit heavy... after having no luck with lighter ones, I realize the weight is worth it.
In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  One other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks, but if it lasts I would definitely recommend it.
Best hair dryer! Same dryer as my hair stylist.
It's a good product to buy. it's very useful.
good
Works good and outside stays cool.  Durable and heats and cools quickly.  Turbo mode great.  Be aware this dryer is very large.  The plastic hair thingy is a gimmick, but the dryer is good.
Great lightweight hair dryer with 2 speeds, worked well in Italy.  Might be difficult to change to US current, but I will keep it for the next trip overseas.
well pleased
Light weight, dries efficiently. I reall like this dryer.
Arrived on time.  Nice, powerful small travel hair dryer.
excellent
Works great
Great buy.  Works just as advertised
very nice very powerful and I like the folding handle. dries my hair in no time!
Save a lot of time!
Small, light in weight & easy to use. It does the job & I love it!
my wife loves it.
Nice and does not fry hair!
Great power! Shortened my drying time quite a bit.
Great wall mount dryer.
very good
Love this dryer! Had it for a couple of years and it's still going strong. Powerful and HOT!
I love this hairdryer. It has a lot of power and I like that it has three heat settings as well as two fan settings .  It is not too loud and not too heavy.
Love this hair dryer for the price!
I love this in that it dries my hair fast. Hood needs to be deeper - but does the trick.  My hair is short - could be hard for someone with long hair.
Very happy with this hair dryer, and the price!  I have baby fine hair, and I'm able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy.  I clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years, until it finally died, since the 1800-watt dryers I'd tried had all given me dismal results.  Maybe it's the ceramic that makes the difference - but in any event I am pleased with this purchase!
Just as fast drying as promised.  Glad for the force choices.  The high speed seems to tangle my straight bob
Fit right where the old dyers was mounted. Great replacement for a reasonable cost.
Wow.  Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the $20 ones I have been using my whole life.  I couldn't be more wrong!  This dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything I've tried before.  Please read on to hear about the technology, results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge!<br /><br />The Technology<br />Rather amazing technology here from the engineers at Panasonic.  Using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer.  By doing this, they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair.  Panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why Japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers.<br /><br />The Results<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, hair is dried quicker and with softer, shinier results!  My hair is short, but for most women with longer hair, the results should be even better!  It is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat, so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair.<br /><br />Before you use:<br />You must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer.  Since it was designed for the Japanese domestic market, it is made for their electrical system, not the U.S.  Although the plugs in Japan and the U.S. look the same, the electricity supply is very different.  I am an electrical engineer and I have lived in Japan, continue to use many Japanese products in the U.S. so I understand the differences well and how to work around them.  In Japan they use 100 volts, however in the U.S. we use 120 volts.  That means by plugging in a Japanese product directly into the U.S. system, you would overload the product by 20%.  For a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design!  Indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.  I have heard poor quality control on Chinese made ones, so given the high cost of the dryer (or any other Japanese product you would consider, i.e. Panasonic Nanocare steamer) I would invest in the best transformer.  Furthermore, I would not hesitate to purchase a Japanese transformer used on eBay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal (they come up from time-to-time.)<br /><br />5 stars!  When used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair!d some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective.  However, if properly used this should not happen.  In fact, I noticed that when I use mine, the hair dryer itself stays quite cool.<br /><br />See my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v (if it were ok for U.S. it would have a range that included 120v).  I have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer.  Note the first one with the power off, my voltage reader measures 105volts (this is close enough to 100v).  The second one has the power on, and it is consuming 1148 watts.  (That is more than many microwaves, so you can imagine with 20% overload why people were experiencing bad smells, melting and early failure!)<br /><br />I warn that a proper stepdown transformer (capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer) will be expensive.  But used within its capacity will last forever.  I personally recommend Japanese made transformers from companies such as Sanyo, Nissyo or Toyozumi.

Meets my needs perfectly.!
good so far
YES!!!
This is a new kind of dryer for me. It has an ionizer in it or something similar to that. When the hair dryer is on there is an orange glow coming from the nozzle. I have very thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. This hair dryer cut that time down significantly. I would definitely recommend it
Another great product. You have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus. I hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy,  and it's much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way. I have very fine, short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it's very fast.
Perfect size for the small suitcase I had to use for a trip to Italy.  It has good power and works well.
I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy. I decided to research smaller hair dryers & this one looked great. I just tried it today & to my surprise, I liked it!  It dried just as fast as my full size dryer.
Wife loves it.
GF brought it and loves it. I am a guy and don't use it myself.
Works like a professional hair dryer should.
Works excellently.  Can easily clean out the air intake grill-work.  Only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure.
Nice cheap dryer.
great product for a great value. honestly was worried about the price point at first but it was a good buy :)
I got this hair dryer to replace a dryer I had for several years.  This one is really good.  It provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings. I would recommend it.
perfect
Great price.
My wife and I needed a new hair dryer, and we had good luck with Conair in the past, so I thought I would try this new model which was just introduced.  Works really great, and much much quieter than the old one, too.  Absolutely would recommend it!  5 Stars.
Best blow dryer I have ever owned! Loved the solid feel and design!
wow
Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working. Wow they just don't make them like they used to.<br />Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  But this one is wonderful. Noise level is pleasant. Lightweight for this 110 pound girl.<br />Love the heat options. Does a wonderful job. I hope it lasts.
Great dryer
Wife thinks this thing is the best dryer she's ever had!  Claims it drys her hair quickly without leaving all the static. I wouldn't know since I'm bald but I'm glad I bought it for her.
My wife loves it. A great Mothers Day present
perfect for air travel as is compact and fits in my cloth bag-love that it has the diffuser.
Great dryer works fast and has a long cord so you can move around.
This dryer is just what I wanted.
works great - the 2 nozzles come on and off fine - much lighter than my previous dryer.
I've never had it in me to buy an expensive blow dryer, so I'm no expert on dryers. But I'm very satisfied with this one. Very powerful and  you can't beat the price
Worka well
I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer. It gets hot enough but not too hot. It is perfect for styling. Very happy with it.
excellent great buy
I love it! It's not as strong as I expected, but my hair dries super fast.
This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half. Light weight and easy to use. The only thing I would change is maybe the location of the switches. I find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair.
excellent
Great hair dryer and so easy to install.
Good power and nicely styled.
POWERFUL AND NOT EXPENSIVE, IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE,LOVE IT
wife likes it
If I had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair. I admit that I love to buy beauty products, but especially hair products. My hair is colored/highlighted, fairly straight, but not thin. Lately I keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair. Little did I know that using the Conair Tourmaline Hair Dryer would solve that problem immediately. The dryer has settings for the usual hot/cold/warm settings and high/medium/low...but it's nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device. It's a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100%. My co-workers noticed my hair looking better too. Ironically, I don't always use a blow dryer because I want healthy hair, but this dryer seems to make my hair look better. For the price and function, I recommended this dryer.
The wife loves it!...the night light is bright, but not harsh!
First discovered this brand of hairdryer at a hotel that my husband and I stayed at and loved so much that when we got home I went online to find one.  It is made very well, a little more expensive than what you would pay for one from walmart but that was okay with me.  I haven't always had good luck in the past with hairdryers but I think I'll have this Andis for a long time.
Works really well. My hair is short but it did what I wanted it to do.  Good investment.
Perfect. Just as described.
This hair drying is great for travel. Perfect size!
Excellent 100%
Hair dryer works perfectly HIGHLY RECCOMEND
Great Dryer, easy to put on wall. Very Happy with it. Nice nite lite.
Love this dryer.  I specifically chose it because it is not as loud as others.
Lots of power in this little guy - handle folds if storage is a problem in a drawer or a suitcase.
This is perfect for travel.  It is the smallest dryer I have seen, but it's power is not diminished.
This hair dryer was all it was advertised to be.  It is very easy to use and light weight.
Worth the money and good quality no issues
Great product
Favorite hairdryer!
The perfect pink dryer!! I love it! Thank you!
I bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in Disney! I was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried, the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine. Love the retractable cord. My hair is very fine and fly-away, especially in the humid weather. My style held even in the Florida heat. So, I came home and ordered one. Love it!
Love this dryer.  I have been looking for this old-style dryer like my aunt used when she was a stylist.  Always loved it great to find one works wonderfully.
good
This hair dryer is fantastic!!  I can dry my hair in half the time it used to take me with my old dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it's so annoying to have to dry it but when I do this is the best one I've ever used.
Work so well we bought two!
great quality
Works well. Folds easily. Very handy for travel. Had another one for many years and it very stopped working. (Was stolen from our van during a cross country trip.)
Would absolutely buy it again! The highest speed is great! Even though I have short hair I'm sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick!
A solid hairdryer.  Not high-end, but perfect for the price.
I really like the hair dryer. The cool switch is great. In other hair dryer I had to hold down the cold button. Does its Job.
Excellent
I love this hair dryer. It dries my hair quickly, and my hair dries very smooth and soft. I had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked, but I was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem. Must have been a fluke, but it was very easy to return!
Good hairdryer for the price. Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy. This one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer.
Nice blow dryer.  Comes with a comb too, which is what i needed.  I love it.
Perfect dryer for travel or home use.  Powerful and lightweight.
The best hair dryer I have used in 15 years. My hair is thick and unruly. Humidity makes it impossible to do anything but this hair dryer has helped tremendously.
works as expected, compact, just what i needed to take to the pool with me
Really good quality, l liked it so much l bought 4,
Works great! Hook for cord is a nice plus
Love it!
We were looking for a good quality, simple hair drier. This one seemed to fit the bill.<br />It works well, dries hair quickly, and seems to help tame the &#34;Frizzies.&#34; We have been using it for quite a while now, and have had absolutely no issues with it.
thanks
My Wife Really Likes This Dryer, We Would Like Panasonic Extended Warranty!
excellent!
Best blowdryer I have ever owned. Well worth the money!
I love this hair drywr.  At 1600 watts it dries my hair rapidly.  It's compact size makes it lighter and easier to handle than those bulky dryers that must be held foot away from the head.  This is a real plus for folks with arthritis in the shoulder or neck joints. It fits easily into a drawer in the bathroom and it doesn't take up much room in a suitcase for travel.  This is my second hair dryer of this type..  The first one was purchased several years ago, and it still works perfectly even after 4-5 years of nearly daily use.  This unit was purchased as a replacement for a similar 1200 watt dryer (different brand) that I kept in my swimming bag but that finally stopped working after 30 years.
powerful and fast drying
Replaced a like unit which had lasted 6 years
Girlfriend loves it! Not too hot for hwr hair.
does a great job!
Great prpduct for the price
I bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three -- just not what I wanted.  I kept looking at the Rimini 1800W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic on Amazon -- it was the color that caught my eye first -- that beautiful blue.  After I returned the third dryer, I came back to the Rimini 1800W.  I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn't be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don't let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it's fabulous!  It's full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don't continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that's at medium heat, high power.  I'm so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?
A huge step up from the one it replaced.  Feels solid and works great.
I've had this hair dryer for almost 4 years now, and to this day I love it. I have dry, frizzy, Hermione Granger-esqe hair so I needed something that wouldn't feel like I'm frying it. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone. It comes with a diffuser which I only used like once or twice but it's ok. I'm gonna have this one for awhile, I love the sleek design too, I don't see it becoming outdated like those pink and green hair dryers from the 70s or something. Thanks scientists at Conair, I salute you.
Very nice hair dryer. My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don't SLIDE it as with my last dryer. Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc....works well, looks good, nice controls. I am happy with it. I don't think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.
Best hair dryer I have ever purchased!  I have always bought the high end expensive hair dryers, but this one far exceeds any dryer I have bought!  Not too hot, light weight and my hair is dryer in 5 minutes less than my last hair dryer!  I'm very happy with my purchase!
Best wall mounted hair dryer I have owned.  Love it!
I love this hairdryer. Purchased it for a trip abroad but my gym dryer &#34;died&#34; last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact, it dries my hair quickly. The dual voltage is a plus. Very pleased with the purchase.
Great mini dryer with plenty of power. Only problem is that it's loud on high setting.
better price than walmart. can't live without it!
Fits my T3 Micro. Model #53888 R. The barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter. Push in and twist, it will latch and stays on perfectly. This is a great value and works well.
It is the 2nd one I have purchased. Love it!
I bought this hair dryer probably 3 years ago and never got around to posting a review. This hair dryer is fantastic- I have had it for 3 years or so and I have never had a problem or malfunction. It drys my hair fast and reduces frizz. I will always buy Elchim.
love it.
It took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that I didn't think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair. I decided on this despite some bad reviews, and am glad that I did. It's pretty (I know this isn't important to some people), and it dries really well. I haven't had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it.
I heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers. I haven't invested in a more expensive one and I may not need to. This baby is enduring through my blowouts! The ion technology is fantastic - it leaves my hair soft and smooth! With regular cleaning this has lasted longer than any other one I owned and really is keeping my hair in good shape. It's a great supplemental dryer as well and the coating is easy to grip along with a nice, light weight.
Great dryer.  Lightweight and easy to handle.  Great heat and cool features.
I actually like this blow dryer very much. It makes my hair very smooth and silky. And I don't have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches, as others have stated. I would recommend this blow dryer to anyone.
A great addition to my hair styling toolbox!  Dries my hair in about 7 minutes.  Love the different settings and the extra part for directing the air to go where you want it.
Wonderful product - excellent service.  Thank you!
Good product.
Works just fine!
I have purchased many blow dryers and this one has been my favorite.
No night light on this model - just what I wanted.  It is smaller, so the power is a little lower, but it fits in my small bathroom
Gets my hair dry faster than my old dryer.
Fast Shipping! Great product! No issues!
Amazing hair dryer!
Over all great product! It's stylish, light weight, easy to use and hold. Very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer. You have all the functions like hot and cool, high and low. The black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol. All in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price!
It is a good quality product, I have been using it since 2013 and it is working perfectly. However, I do not blow dry my hair everyday, I only use it occasionally.
Better than my wife's old one. The hair dryer that she had was pretty expensive, but it finally died. I read the reviews on this one and decided to purchase it as a replacement. She loves it. The new hair dryer is quieter and she loves the cool dry feature. Can't beat it for the price and how it works.
Works great, fast shipping, thanks
This hair dryer is worth every penny! I read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer.  So when my over $100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year, I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did because not only is it light weight, it cut my drying time down, and it helped smooth out my hair. I never knew a dryer could do that, especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy.
Does what it is supposed to do. Could maybe blow air a little stronger but otherwise, a perfectly good hair dryer. Comes with a diffuser and a concentrator (that I will never use...)
LIGHT WEIGHT AND JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HEAT
This small Conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer. It is compact and easy to handle. I hope they never quit making this model.
works great
It is lightweight & has 3 heat settings.  I love the 2 attachments.
Everyone loves it
Very good
This hair dryer performs exactly as expected and advertised.  I recommend it.
Very happy with this hair dryer
Does the trick
very good great heat control
I usually cut corners with this stuff. This is still a cheap dryer, but it's very good quality. The matte look is nice, has three settings for heat and three settings for how much air is pushed. Plus the cool button! It's worked great for half a year now. If it broke I'd buy another one!
Love the light weight and ease to hold.  Big dryers are too heavy for me.  Good strong blow power and fast drying
Awesomeness
love love love good for my hair
Works as expected fast delivery
great item
We love this unit-nite light too!
Great product.  Worked awesome in London and Scotland while using a Universal All in one interantional travel power plug adapter.
The best dryer ever....
I love this dryer. It works great and it is quiet
I love this blow dryer, I love that there is a medium setting!!
I love this small and easy to carry hair dryer, ideal for traveling. I will use Amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service.
Already had one. Bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom. Great product.
Love it! The power, the light weight, the settings & especially easy to pack because it folds up! I have fibromyalgia and my hands sometimes will not let me hold things. The grip on this is easy & it's light weight so it doesn't hurt to hold it when drying my hair.
It's so nice!
Excellent hair dryer !!!!
Been using this twice daily for over a year. Simple, effective. You don't really need anything more than this to make wet hair dry. My dog would probably give it a 1 star review, but he is biased because he hates hair dryers in general.
Had this product for several years and wore it out. Sure glad it was still available. Does the job better than most.
Excellent dryer!  I would recommend it to everyone
This is a very well built little dryer and works well.
It's a tad heavier than I would like but I love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer. It does a great job.
Excellent. Great Value. I love to retractable cord- folding aspects of this dryer. I put I'd away neatly in a drawer / out of sight .
Great price for an adequate hair dryer.
Great diffuser
Awesome
Bought for my Mother, and it does what it is supposed to do.
good hair dryer!  10mins to dry my long hair ! I am so happy
Ionizes and retracts. It has great power.
OMG, I have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years!  After my favorite dryer broke, I looked for one like it that is lightweight, has power but not too much power, and most importantly, has the high/low/off switch on the BACK of the dryer handle, not in the front.  All of the dryers I have looked at in the past have the switch(es) on the front of the handle.  This is a problem for me, because when I style my hair with a dryer and a round brush, I have to constantly turn the dryer on and off.  With the buttons on the back of the handle like this one, I can turn it on and off with one hand.  When the buttons are on the front of the handle, I have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands.  What a hassle!  This lightweight dryer with the on/off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly.  I will probably buy another one as a back-up for when this one wears out.  I highly recommend this dryer, and you can't beat the price!
Good!
These little dryers are just great in my room and the guest room. Small enough to be out of the way but plenty of power to dry my thick hair.<br />My guests love them
Great service. I just wish that I had realized that the barrel is so long. My wife has a short arm  and has difficulty using the dryer.
Replacement dryer for the original one I broke. Love it.
as expected
excellent
This thing is a miracle worker. My curls have never look bigger and bouncier!
I bought this hair dryer because it's dual voltage and I needed something for a trip to Italy.  It worked wonderfully in Europe.  And it's working great at home too.  Nice and powerful.
very happy with the unit.
Fantastic product.. Save time each morning with this amazing product
I really like this hair dryer! Although it's a bit heavy on my hands as I'm using it, it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth with minimal frizz. It also dries my hair efficiently and quickly. Highly recommend it and it's at a great price!!
Changed my drying time.  Great product
great product
Got this for my mom, who wanted a dryer with a strong &#34;blow.&#34; I have a Remington that is great (but that model is no longer available), so I got her this one based on other positive reviews, and she really likes it.
Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!
processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning and this is a great home alternative. gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  love it.
Size and heat output is a great combo
This was a gift for my wife.  It has worked flawlessly for months now.  Great product.
Excellent.
My teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink.  Sometimes the cord would be IN the sink!  This freaked me out a bit so I ordered this wall unit.  This was easy and quick to install.  I love it!  My son loves it!
Love, love, love this little hair dryer! I got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It has at least as much power as the full size dryer I am replacing. I haven't missed the old one for a minute. Plus, as promised, this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy.
Very easy purchase. Dryer works great. Totally satisfied customer.
Received exactly when promised. Product is exactly what I was looking for and met or exceeded expectations.
This hairdryer is the best I have had!!!  It is much better than even my $125 hairdryer.
This is now my favorite hair dryer. I use it every day. It's so light my wrist doesn't get tired.
Dries as it should with aesthetic looks.
I waited 6 mos to write this review because I wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long. This thing is perfect for home use. I use it on myself and my daughter. roller sets come out perfect. twistouts dry in half the time wash and go's have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster. I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min. In Short... I love this dryer and if anything happened to it I would gladly purchase again. I ordered my dryer the week of Christmas it was on my doorstep the next day
Works perfectly.
Excellent product
Being a guy I never saw a need for a hair dryer, but recently I found it gives me a ton of volume (Duh). This is a great buy and the attachment works wonders during styling. Not to mention, if you are a hairy guy, it makes the drying process of the rest of your body a lot easier!
I read the reviews on this hair dryer and decided to give it a try. Going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer. This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and this thing works great great, it's amazing for its size how much power it has. I have a very expensive Ionic ceramic dryer and this thing dries my hair just as well. I've actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong!
Great product and amazing price!!!
Everyone that comes over comments: â€œWHERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!â€?it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. itâ€™s easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in itâ€™s holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.<br />I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didnâ€™t have to drill holes. Itâ€™s holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off itâ€™s mount and work with it directly. Great buy
Works great. My wife really liked it for Mother's Day. Its dries her hair faster than her old one.
This hair dryer is light, quiet, and best of all, the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button. I love, love, LOVE this feature.
Love it!!!! I've had it for couple of months now. Definitely recommend it.
Great
Very good hair dryer. Mounting bracket works very good.
I shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when I came across this one... so I thought I would give it a chance.  I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage.
I hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used, she was right.  I'm pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie Twister to make the tornadoes.
Super product!
my roommates couldn't keep their hands off this
Great hair dryer! It's the perfect size and drys your hair quickly!
Vickie loves it ,
love everything about it
I love this hair dryer.  I have had 3.  Every time one stops working, I buy another one.  It makes my hair look and feel great.
Just the right size and power for travel.
Perfect! Good power.
Small but packs some serious heat and power!
Heats great, love the ergonimical style
I love this hair dryer
Works great
LOVE this hairdryer!! I keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing I've done differently is to start using this blow dryer (with no cut or professional styling in months)! The small diffuser was a tight fit at first, but the more I've used it, the easier it's gotten. I guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit. Never had a problem with the curling diffuser. 2 months in and am satisfied so far!
Good product
fit my old wall mount - works great!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT. Very strong wind and make my hair dry much faster. can't live without it,
Love it
The best hair dryer.  In fact this was a replacement for the one I had for ten years
Works great,gave me my independence back.
Love this
Love it!  Does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.
just like we use when we travel (Mariott uses these)
Very good product!
Good hair dryer!
Great for speed drying and traveling.
Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly. Love it.
Quietiest Hair dryer that we've ever owned.  Very powerful, drys quickly and efficiently.  Love this hair dryer!
I absolutely love this dryer! The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time! I would buy this again!
Great product quiet like I've never experienced I forget it's on if I walk away from it! Lol<br />Gets really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low ..best dryer ever and I've owned 7
Great product
Great dryer! Lighter weight and less damaging than my old one. This is being picky, but I wish the switched the positions of the power and heat setting buttons. I hold the dryer in my left hand and the brush in my right (do other righties do this?). My left thumb is closest to the heat setting button (that I never change) and farther away from the on/off switch (which I use between every section of hair. The result? Accidentally switching the hear setting to &#34;blast furnace&#34; and burning my scalp. Conair, one little change, please!
This dryer is amazing! It works better than the shop dryers. It's super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer..me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t.v. This dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble. The shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it. I recommend this dryer to anyone.
I have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and WITHOUT frizzies! Love it!
This dryer is so light weight!! I was amazing by that. It is perfect for what I needed.
Great power, compact shape, easy to use. This is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day.
I got this as a gift to my mom and she love it !!!!
I love it. No more clutter in the bathroom.
I like tha it has the hot and warm heat adjustment.  Works great.
Great hairdryer!
My favorite hair dryer, powerful, totally recommended!
Good value I am very happy.
So this blow dryer has a purple hint of color just an fyi and love it. I used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends, instantly. So I used it for the first time and no split ends, yay!. I also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends. I use the RedKen Satinwear Blow dry Lotion before I start blow drying and both combined work wonders. Your hair will look like you just came out of the salon.
good product
Love the hot pink!  Different speeds and heat settings are fantastic.  Re-tractable cord works well.
I love the amount of air it produces and the multiple heat and blow settings!
Love this hair dryer. It dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft.
Exactly what I was looking for! Here's hoping it lives a long and service-oriented life.
Best hair dryer I have ever owned!
Absolute bargain of the century! My wife had two Chi's break in the course of around five years. While most would argue that 2-3 years is adequate - when one pays $100+ for a hairdryer, you expect to see many long years of service. Instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced Chinese made hair dryer, we took a gamble on the Herstyler Pro. The result? My wife is 101% pleased - really. FIt and finish is as good as the Chi. Logical button placement and function is perfect. Temps are ideal, force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional. They could double the price and it would still be a steal. VERY well done. I like it so much, we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost.
Good
Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it, except there is no diffuser but she has managed.
Love it. Not to hot, drys my hair quickly and my hair looks fab. What more could I ask for. I'm glad I did not get one of the more pricey dryers.
Works very well and fast. I have medium long wavy hair. It looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product. I am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore.
Very good quality product for good price
Perfect
I have had a couple of these over the years.  They've been great.  Lasted a long time.  Easy to mount.  Great night light too.
Great dryer, easy to hold, made really well, drys hair in no time at all
Amazing value!
Great little travel dryer.  Super strong for the size!
I use this to style my epic beard. It is great. The only down side I can thik of is the attachment only fits this hair dryer. This is a great hair dryer at a great price.
It dries so fast it is great! I had brought one over from France that my mom had gotten years and years ago but unfortunately I was never able to get the same power due to the voltage difference. I ordered this one and it is the same to the T (except color). Cut down my hair routine in half.<br />It does fume and heats up A LOT so be careful!<br />(I have black relaxed hair)
Purchased several of these a few years ago. Gave one as a gift and my wife kept one. She loved hers, so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement. My wife likes the size, power and temperature of this hair dryer and rates it 5 stars.
Best hair dryer I've used. Light weight and dries hair fast.
Love it, lots of power and drys my hair quickly
Used this dryer during a recent trip to Europe.  So easy to use in different countries and compact to carry. Couldn't ask for a better, more efficient dryer.  I even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room, but don't tell anybody.
Works well
Works beautifully and fast.  Lots of heat choices.  Hot is hot with this dryer.  I had to wear a terry headband around my forehead, ears, neck because of the &#34;leakage&#34; of hot air, but otherwise, it dried my curly hair very quickly, almost as fast as at the salon.  Love the thin case and the way the power cord, bonnet and air hose store in the case.  I worried about where I'd store this in a small apartment, but it's no problem.
Works great and keeps my daughter from borrowing my wife's all the time.
Good product. Received quickly. As expected.
Great product, fast delivery and reasonable price! Highly recommended!
This is our second wall mounted hair dryer and I can see some improvements in the design.  We are very happy with its performance.
Super powerful and versatile!
Why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer? Which I've put away in the guest bathroom. This is a great little dryer. I wish it had a quick cool shot button, but I wouldn't avoid buying it for that reason.
works really well.
I've only used this for a couple of weeks, but so far has met my expectations.  Just installed a new handicapped shower, mounted this just outside the shower above a GFI receptacle.  it does a great job both drying me off, and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water. My soap now stays dry and firm, and my bath mat doesn't get waterlogged.<br />Best feature - The magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle. Most plastic latches fail after a few months, but the magnet should be bulletproof. I also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower. If one doesn't have a &#34;backer board&#34; I recommend &#34;Molly&#34; anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket.
Good
Love this hair dryer!!
None
This works well.Very gentle and it makes my hair smooth.Bought it for a few months and works well.
Dry's  well and is small enough to pack for travel.
very good and i love it!
great dryer.
works great!  Just a little heavy.
I love the number of options this dryer gives you as far as heat and intensity. The attachment is smooth and the dryer is quiet. Good purchase.
This is the best blow dryer.
Takes up very little space.  Has a nightlight.  Very powerful.
Multiple settings, light, and easy to use
My hair has never been better!!!
Had the blow dryer for several months now... no problem does not over heat.... best investment
Love this dryer. Professional results without the price!
great
Better than expected- really great value to price ratio. Did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons. Love the settings, cool setting a big + and a cold button for a burst of chilly air. 2 speeds, 3 setting plus cold button, fantastic air flow, does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands. Would gladly buy again!
When wife is happy with purchase, husband is happy with purchase
Works so good I bought another one when my wife decided to take the first one with her to her exercise class each morning.
I simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product.  My reasons for a 5-star rating:<br /><br />Positives:<br />* Powerful and efficient - hair dries quickly without being blown wild<br />* Able to easily style while drying<br />* Comes with two attachments AND they stay in place wonderfully<br />* Retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses<br />* For a hair drying styler, this is not excessively loud<br /><br />Negatives:<br />* No complaints!<br /><br />This has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister's awhile ago!  I finally confirmed the type to purchase.  Then, I found it on Amazon's &#34;Today's Deals&#34; (daily deals) - even better!  This is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price (as listed or with a deal)!  Over my lifetime, I have used many hair dryers, with a wide price range, and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular....before using this one.  I was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it....I was not disappointed at all!
Replaced a earlier version. Works well. Wife happy
Hair dryer is perfect and haven't had any problems since purchase!
My wife really LOVES this dryer. It was easy to put together and works Great. It dries her long hair just the way she likes it. She's Happy.. I'm Happy.
Love the night light and works great!!
I rate the product 4 stars. It dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit, but nothing out of this world. However, I just interacted with customer service for a problem, and I was very impressed with how the company handled the situation. The product definitely deserves an extra star for customer service!
Very good for travel and very potent.
Great dryer love it
Item delivered on time, was as described
Best blow dryer I have ever purchased.
Great value
I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn't cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don't have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I've always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.
this is perfect, works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size.
Before I ever used this product I thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air. After used my friend's Panasonic Nano hair dryer, I knew I was wrong. This is so much better than the cheap dryer I bought at supermarket. My hair wasn't at all frizzy with this new hair dryer. I'm in love with this product
I love this dryer and wish they made it in a smaller travel size. Only drawback is that the attachment bends easily so if you pack it make sure to take it off first. It heats up better than any other dryer I've used and my salon uses these exclusively.
Great hair dryer.  Doesn't cause too much frizz.  Love the retractable cord.
Great for drying hair!
Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.
I bought this Two days ago as my old dryer (conair 1875 watt) hasn't been drying as well lately.  I was impressed immediately with this dryer.  It is beautiful.  It is slightly heavier than my last one,  but it cut drying time considerably so I don't think this will be an issue.  It has three speeds.  It has three temperature settings. The highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used.  I just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that I don't need to break out my flat iron. Yes, I am amazed by this thing! The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor. I was reading the booklet that was included, and this dryer has a four year warranty.  That's pretty astounding considering the price point.  I love this dryer,  and I'd buy it again in a heart beat.  I'm thinking about buying another one to store,  because I seriously love it that much!  Go buy it!
The wife is very happy with this.  It was a replacement of a similar Conair that lasted many years.  This one has held up for a few months now and looks like it will hold up like the old one.  I am pretty sure she will buy a similar Conair if/when this one breaks.
Love it!
This is an excellent product, I love it!
Works very well.  I have the same blow dryer in the past and that lasted a long time it's a really great blow dryer
I have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until I slept on it. However when I tried it with this blowdryer, even at the fast dry attachment, it was smooth and sleek.<br /><br />Now that I have a digital perm, I can use the diffuser. I put half of my hair twisted, sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser! It works wonderful so far. I'm so happy with this blow dryer. Worth the price. First expensive blow dryer I have owned. Now I can have nice waves.
Makes my hair drying time much shorter.
I have a Conair hair dryer that I use at home.  I bought this one for a trip to the UK because of the dual voltage feature and compact size.  My trip is in three weeks so I am yet to try it out overseas yet but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack.
Favorite model. No longer available in stores. Bought as backup for 3 year old one currently using.
Works great - multiple speed and temps.
In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I'm only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn't bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it's as quiet as the other &#34;quiet&#34; dryers I've owned made by other companies. It's not a whisper, but it's not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It's certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you're going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I'm very happy with my purchase!
Powerful, and quiet. It doesn't have that high pitched whine. It doesn't get super hot and doesn't have to because it's powerful enough. Other dryers would make my hair hot to the touch or burn my hand. My hair seems to be healthier and smoother after using this for a couple months too!
The best
I love the product
The best travel dryer I have found. So much power in this little thing.
Great power and gets the job done fast.
My wife and kids love it; and for that, I'm a happy customer.
Great dryer! Dries fast... The hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself!
This little hair dryer is great! I had one just like it in the past. It lasted 20 years. It fits perfectly in my suit case, has just the right amount of power and heat. It is much better than others I have used (they did not last long). It is well constructed too. A good purchase. I had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products. I am really happy Amazon had it. I highly recommend.
Love love this hair dryer. My first time to own a Turbo Power but should have been buying for years. Live and learn!<br />I have very fine, thin, hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts. After researching the best for my hair issues - the lower wattage, 1500,  is perfect and dries my hair beautifully, smooth and shinny. This dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last.
Bargain price for a great hairdryer - several heat and speed settings, dries your hair quickly! Haven't used the diffuser yet but it is looks good.
Only had my dryer for a month but so far it's the best one I've ever had.  Ionic  feature makes hair smooth.  Seems to be built sturdy.  Folding handle retractable cord work well.  It it holds up it's a super buy at the price .
awesome product. Tucked out of the way in the female's bathroom of my home. I also purchased one for the male's bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once I am complete with the remodel so if I ever get married again she will have one to use. great night light also. never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night..
It is the best hair dryer I have! I used have a old one which I used for many years! Best quality!
Excellent product.  This is one of the best hair dryer i have ever own.  Highly recommended :-)
Overall I am very happy with this product.  My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it's washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It's much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you'll need to purchase one separately.
Fantastic hair dryer! Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know.
I don't know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years. I like this one so far. It is sturdy, but I don't consider it heavy. It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.
this is my 2nd purchase of this product I wore the first one out after 11 years ! it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on. I love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz ! Well worth the money ..one of those cases you get what you pay for!
Very pleased with the dryer.  It's a little heavier than my last one, but does a great job. I would recommend.
I would highly recommend this blow dryer. Even my mother-in-law said it is awesome. It is powerful and dries my hair fast. I plan to look at other products made by them as well.
Sweet, works as expected!
I love it, it fits my little peanut head just fine and really snug. I used it to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap and silk bonnet on top then the hair dryer bonnet. I used the silk bonnet to protect my ears and neck from getting to hot. This is the first time I have ordered this and I'm very happy.
Highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company. My hair is long and thick. It is every texture in the book. Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored. It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry. Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can't tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.<br />Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company. It is because of these that I was prompted to write a review.  A quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out.
we liked this so much we bought them for the rest of the bathrooms! convenient and easy to install. it even has a tiny night light built into it.
Great ceramic blow dryer, arrived promptly, entirely satisfied!
Love this dryer, ordered with Amazon Prime under 12 , 2 day arrival and use just for my Wonder Wash and Vapper dry system, wash in Wonder Wash, wring, hang on dryers until near dry and hang inside Vapper last few minutes for warm towels, shirts, light robes, socks etc good laundry system under 90, no more laundry mats!.
The wall mount dryer was just what I needed for my new small bathroom as I do not have any counter space.  Works great!
Update:  :(  3rd time using it on travel.  Love this little dryer.... fits great in my hand, easy control.... 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and then......... oh no!!!!  it died.  Not circuit tripped. I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  I was in denial.  i just shook it and then, headed out to Walmart with my 3/4 blown out hair, with the one section not done in a french braid.  :)  LOL....  alas, back to a big dryer.  I really liked this but only got to use it 3 times.<br />_____<br />Purchased for travel because of it's small size. Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  love it.
broke my arm and went on vacation so this little gadget hellped a lot. It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door.
Best hairdryer I have ever used.  Large impellers really put out some air which speeds drying.  Can be very powerful or not depending on the setting you choose.
Perfect hairdryer.
Wonderful! Just what I was looking for. I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It smooths as it dries. Is light weight and quiet. And I love how hot it gets- lets me know its really working!
excellent
My hair normally takes forever to dry, but not with this dryer. It  drys so quickly and will NOT dry out your hair. Worth every penny
Very good
Suits my needs very well. Quiet and compact.
Perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right! I wish it was a tad more powerful but I can live with it &#34;as is&#34;.
This is a very good dryer,I give it 5 stars.<br />Thanks
Very small and very light.  Perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles.  I recommend this product.
fit right where we needed it in our motorhome
Heavy Duty awesome dryer. The cord alone lends itself to the words &#34;heavy duty&#34;. Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options. The best dryer I've ever purchased in my 50+ years, that is when hand held dryers began. I have long hair and it's cut my time in half. I can't say more other than I hope it last me a long time.
Extremely fast delivery and the product works great. Very happy!
it's great i enjoy working it. thanks much ðŸ˜
as expected! good
Dries my hair incredibly quickly. What used to take 20 minutes now takes 5, it makes getting ready in the morning much more pleasant.
I have long thick hair and I go through blow dryers like crazy. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly. It's not too heavy and is easy to hold. Love it!
I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer. I wanted the ceramic ionic technology as I have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily. This hair dryer has been amazing. It's super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great. I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes. I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.<br /><br />I also have to say that Xtava has excellent customer service. When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one. Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon. I now own two Xtava dryers and love them both. I'm really happy with my purchases, and the quality of the Xtava products. I highly recommend this dryer.
I have had three of these over the years. Ionizing dryer keeps the frizz out of your hair. Cool setting is nice in addition to the two settings for hot, blasting and normal. Great hair dryer!
Love it dry so fast , not very good with freez but for the price is good.
Great
Love the small size and the way that it dries my hair.  Great little hair dryer.
This is the 4th time I've bought this dryer over the course of a several years. It does fail at some point, but at the constant daily use it gets. Still very worth the price, it's quite powerful and puts out more heat and airflow than others I've used. Very happy with it overall!
Excellent noise levels--very low. Heat control very good as well. Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models.
The retractable cord is wonderful for storage.  Power is great.
great product for price
This is a great little dryer. I bought it after using one in a hotel and wanting one for myself. It is very basic but does the job without destroying my eardrums. A minor complaint is that the cord is bit on the short side, but I cope with it.
Great little dryer
makes my hair smooth
I am so excited by this dryer. It much quieter than my old one and dries my hair super fast without feeling dried out.
Not disappointed. Works well and super small, perfect for travel.
BEST BLOWDRYER for NATURAL GIRLS. I Never use anything else
very fast drying experience!
Pleased with packaging and shipping. Pleased with product. Its better than our other brands and love how fast it dries my hair and leaves it less frizzy.
This hair dryer performs as expected.  I have dry/damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago.  I have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave/curl would make it look better but it didn't.  However this is not due to the hair dryer.  The hair dryer is light, was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator. I tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate.  Feature I love the most: adjustable heat setting.  I use the warm instead of hot and I can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast I want it.  Great dryer for the price but also for all of the features.
I've used this dryer for over a year now and I think it works really well. I don't find any difference between this dryer and normal dryer but it blow dries  my hair really quickly and has options for cold and hot air.
This is one powerful hair dryer. The heat can be controlled along with the height and hood position.
Great
THIS ISTHE BEST  DRYER I HAVE EVER USED
Love this dryer the best that I have found so far.
Pro:  lightweight, good power, less frizzies<br />Con:  have to unplug nightlight in bathroom to accommodate the large GFC plug of dryer
Works great!! Dries my hair quickly and stores beautifully with the retractable cord and folding handle !! So glad I got it ; )
I was iffy after I ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it, but I really like this hair dryer.  I only use the cold settings to dry my hair in general.  I am already using it for a few months and I love it.  Don't depend on what people have to say unless you try it.  Unless of course it is all bad.
This is a great hair dryer at a great price.  My wife already had this one and has been using it for several years.. So when my other brand hair dryer died, I bought this one and so far so good.  I have been using it for about 3 months now.
Works great
Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  Bought this solely to use when I travel, because not all places provide a hair dryer.  But the places that do provide a hair dryer, the quality is poor.  So...bought one for myself and love it!  Especially the pink color and small little zebra print carrying case.
This is a great hair dryer - it seems to be designed well. It's definitely pretty - doesn't take up too much space. It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style. It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it's called the nozzle, but it's key to minimizing damage on your hair.<br /><br />My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.<br /><br />I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems. So, I'm happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I'm in the market to buy something like this, I'll check xtava first.
I love my Andis Ceramic blow dryer. Not only does it get our hair dry quickly but it also straightens at the Sam's time. Can't get no better for me and my family. Quick and easy!
The best hair dryer I ever used!!
Very light weight, easy to use with one hand as you round brush with the other... and overall was above my expectations!
Love this hairdryer! So fast and light. Cut styling time in half
This is the best blow dryer I ever purchased. I have very thick long hair. With this dryer it dried in no time
wonderful hair dryer and at a good price
Great hair dryer
Works great.
excellent
I'm profesional hairstylist and i love it.
I bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it, so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the GFCI plug I knew I had to purchase it again.  The retractable cord is just brilliant -- every hair dryer should have this feature.  The cool shot button is handy to help set your style.  And the diffuser attachment is just *fabulous*, with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution.  I am so glad Conair is still making this model and that Amazon carries it.
Powerful!
Has lots of power to dry hair quickly and it is great for travel.
Best hairdryer ever!
good product
excelent fast.  love it
Purchased this over two months ago and it is the best hairdryer I've ever used!! I get disappointed whenever I use any other hair dryer because it's simply not the same! Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily. Perfect temperature for me as well. Very happy with my purchase! Thank you!
It's perfect!  Adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers!
Wife love the style and performance.
Works great for the price. Leaves hair shiny.
Phenomenal product
Great for travel.  And does a nice job styling hair.
Excellent and very durable hairdryer. This is a heavy quality dryer; no cheap light-weight plastic here. Comes with 2 attachments. Would be nice if it came with a retractable cord, but money well spent nonetheless.
It works as it should be working
Great! Its light, efficient and has a super cute design. Its even easier to use than my mom's expensive hair dryer.
Spectacular, light-weight, compact and an outstanding price!  I purchased two!!
Low noise good hair dryer
A little noisy, but powerful, small enough to pack. Cord is a bit on the short side, but it's perfect for my use.
LoBe it
works great
Great product !
Worked perfect!
Powerful and small. Like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn't take over my drawer space.
exactly what I needed. love it.
This is the best of hair dryer. Light weight, efficient, dual voltage and work fine
i love my hair dryer. my hair does dry in less time.
Works as well as more expensive products of similar type.
As an international traveler, I love the Dual Voltage!!
Very light, fries my hair quickly. Like the cool button.
Love it. Works great doesnt over heat! Perfect buy!
I liked the hair dryer it. It is like the ones at the hair salon.
My only complaint is that the extension does not clip on. Whenever I put the dryer away, the piece falls off and I have to go fishing for it. Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time. The highest heat setting is HOT.
Love this blow dryer.  Hair so much easier to manage with this dryer than my old that just got &#34;hot&#34;.
I loved it
I had bought this blow dryer in a convenient store and loved it!  I went back and purchased an extra one for my guest bathroom for company to use.  Our family has a lot of birthdays in March and I thought this would be a great gift for my daughters.  The convenient store did not have any of these left, so I went to my Trusty Amazon and bought two from them. All of our daughters have waist length to knee length hair and I have very thick and long hair and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair.  This blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins.  I love this thing!!  We don't understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair and we have never had this issue.  If you want a powerful blow dryer, this is the one for you..
Nice hairdryer. Simple and solid. I use mine for drying off my goldendoodle when she's been out in the rain.
I really like it for a couple of reasons. The size and also the blower, it is the best I have ever used.<br />One problem, I had one before this order and it only lasted a year.
Great seller and great product, this hair dryer is manageable and leaves my hair perfect. The drier is a bit heavy but other than that, perfect size and it makes wonders
great for the guest room
Works really well, and fun colors
Great product!
Excellent hair dryer. I love it because I can get very high heat on a low or high blow setting. Also it cools down quickly on the cool air setting to lock in styles. Just enough blow power and plenty of choices for temp and speed. Easy to handle.
Works well , used for a whole 2 hours to dry some stuff.
Just what I was wanting!!!
Work really nice is awesome. .....
I bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and I had to buy it again. It's efficient and travels well!
I wish I had this dryer forever!
Love, love, love it!!! Very comfortable to use, controls in the right spot and dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! VERY happy!!! And it has sparkles... :D
I have always had excellent luck with Conair hair dryers.  My previous one lasted over five years!  I have been using this one for a week so far and I love it.  It is lightweight and dries your hair quickly (without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel).  It is a little smaller than my old dryer, so it would also be useful for travel.  Very nice.
EXCELLENT
Very nice. I love the different heat settings and the noise level is really low compared to my old Conair hair dryer
It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful. It is perfect for travel.
Doesn't over dry my hair!  Love it!
The only reason why I bought this blow dryer was that my other hair dryer gave out on me and due highly to the reviews.  The positive reviews were right on with the product.  I would highly recommend this product to the 3 settings for your hair and the add-on.
Momma loved it :)
This hair dryer is light weight and works awesome! I love the multiple settings and the size for travel. So far no issues.
Great little Hair Dryer!! It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.
Works well!
I really like th hair dryer! It drys fast and makes my hair look great! Highly recommended!
very good working and I like me hear after the ions
Excellent, but noisier than I thought.
Best hairdryer I've ever had, love the ease of cord retraction.
This works great. We've had it a few years now and still going strong.
Has great power - just what I was looking for.
Bought this for $20 on Amazon (sale?).  Nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use.  I'm surprised more women don't have hearing loss from all the noise of these things.
Lots of power, works great, hair doesn't seem as dry after using.  Would definitely buy again.
Worked great with adapter.  Just follow instructions on proper settings.
Tons of power! I love this blow dryer! Worth the higher price!
Lightweight and efficient. This is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years.
granddaughter loves it
good
Very Good
Love our hair dryers. They are out of the way yet within reach.
This is by far the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  I have curly hair and have found that the diffuser that comes with it is the best for making my hair have the best curls.  I had actually purchased two other hair dryers (one specifically for curly hair) and they didn't work at all!  The diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair.  Not only that, the hair dryer doesn't blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls.  I also love the cool setting feature on the dryer.  You won't regret purchasing this hair dryer!
good
Sturdy, not heavy and easy to use.
Great.
Use it in a Motor Home and works great.
Works great.  Compact.
I'm a professional and have used this dryer daily for years. Mine recently died so bought another one. Reasonable price too.
excellent: compact and very powerful.
dries your hair very quickly,I am very happy with this product
Good
good buy for the money.  Works perfectly.
This hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to Holland, Belgium, France, and England.  There was no converter needed, just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 V mode and used only on the low setting.  To clarify, you can ONLY use it on the LOW setting, however on the low setting it runs like it is on high - very easy, and worked perfectly.  It is also extremely compact for easy packing, but still worked like a bigger, nice hair dryer.  Hope this helps someone :)
Met my expectations.
GIVEN AS A GIFT AT CHRISTMAS... AWESOME PRODUCT, MY SISTER LOVES IT AND SHE HAS EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR.
I realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow-dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair. I simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of &#34;sticky&#34; and not quite fully dry when I got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5+ year old Conair that I bought at CVS very inexpensively.<br />I did some research online and scoffed at the $150+ dryers that were being promoted. This one was on the list, and honestly, given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers, I was willing to try it out.<br />WOW. I have used it now about 3 times, and it is hard to believe what a significant difference I see in my hair. I styled it myself for a formal Gala event, and was able to achieve the shiny look, feel, and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve. It was unreal. Even on a work day I feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer. It targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry, shiny and healthy.<br />I went back and ordered one to send to my mom! She is also a victim of ignorance-to-bad-dryer-itis, so I went ahead and sent her the cure.<br />Happy Drying!
I absolutely love it!
I'm using this for about a month and its perfect!!!! Fast dryer ever, doesn't harm your hair and the result is like a pro.
This product is very good.
Works great on my fine hair, lots of air, love the heat settings, and the pattern is fun.
I purchased this hair dryer after it was recommended by a friend.  I absolutely love it!  I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  I can't say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!
We bought two wall mount hairdryers to install at a vacation rental.  They work well and are attractive.  They are small, don't take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear.  It was a good choice for us.
As a bald man, I love this hair dryer. It helps my wife dry her hair in a fair amount of time, less than her previous hair dryer. Seems to work pretty good. Typically loud when on, so I leave the room. Also, of note, this hair dryer does not have an actual turbo despite the product description. I feel like this is either false advertising and I have been duped, or the seller has no idea what the hell a turbo actually is. Turbos are found on internal combustion engines, both gasoline and diesel. If 'turbo' is meant to mean something like &#34;strong wind&#34;, they should have used a word like KyÅfÅ«, which is Japanese for &#34;strong wind&#34;. Or maybe the German word for &#34;hair dryer&#34;, which is fÃ¶hn. Either way, don't be fooled. There is no actual turbo, &#34;quiet fan and motor&#34; is subjective. It is loud. And I have not tested the &#34;lifeline shock protection&#34;. I would hope it works, but after the other misleading information, your results may vary.
Im a hairstylist. I have 2 of these. Super light and dries great. Not loud either!
Compact and easy to use
Great purchase! Works perfectly.
Love it....
I love my new Rusk! It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it is easy to hold. The 4 attachments make any style possible.
LOVE this hairdyer!!  Dries my hair in half the time, is so quiet and light in weight.  My girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together.  After our last vacation together I decided it was time I owned my own!
Dry that hair for less than $13...
This is a wonderful hair dryer. I would recommend to anyone.
Second one I have owned. They are great. Last forever and very sturdy.
Excellent, perfect amount of air speed without blowing your hair everywhere like the newer high speed dryers. My second purchase.
pricey but excellent dryer. I like quality items.
Best I've ever bought. I have long thick hair and it only takes about 5-7 minutes to dry with this blow dryer.
Love this little blow dryer, works like a regular size dryer!!!
ABSOLUTELY LOVE NEW HAIR DRYER!!!<br />Exactly what I was wanting, my hair is thick and short and this hair dryer is amazing at getting my hair dried quick!!!
Best hairdryer ever!!!
Love it! It has a lot of power and works very well.
Awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic
Very nice, compact, high quality dryer with good controls - a good value.
I love this hair dryer! I have long, natural hair. I used to blow dry and flat iron my hair until it started breaking and looking *dead*. I heard about this dryer on You Tube from &#34;Sista with Real Hair&#34;. I ordered and received it within 3-4 days. No more blow drying for me. Great Price too!
Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.
This is the best compact hairdryer i ever purchased. So much power.
A good piece of kit. I chose it for my wife she loves it. So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)
Great hair dryer. no complaints
It's really pretty and useful! The delivery is fast! Thanks
Great hair dryer! Shipping was very fast!
Love this hair dryer.
Amazing dryer!! It has cut my drying time down significantly. I have really curly hair & this dryer works very well with my diffuser. I think it is a great value for the money and I'm so happy with my purchase!
Very nice and easy to use.  Works great!
So powerful and light ,for that price it left behind all expensive Italian hairdryers
the quality is very good
Love this dryer especially the cool setting which I use for the first week after I color my hair.  It's lightweight and doesn't make a lot of noise.
Another device that is a powerhouse in a small package.  I had a very expensive white designer hairdresser before this and it still took forever to dry hair, and got so hot doing so that kids and pets yowl.  This dryer works in record time, blows the moisture out like those car dryer things at the car wash, and doesn't burn hair or scalp doing so.  It is also fairly quiet for the power.  I am not a pro hairdresser so can't speak for that, but for the family bath night, it is fast without the  furious.
Product arrived in perfect condition and have had no issues since it arrived.  It was packaged very sustainably and safely. Am very satisfied with customer service.  Totally worth the wait!<br />My girlfriend absolutely loved this as a gift! She said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor.  If you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait.  It will pay itself back in no time!<br />I say it's worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in Italy and takes about two weeks to arrive
Great dryer. It dried my hair in under 10 min. And I have thick hair that reaches my bum. Powerful, my leave your hair a little frizzed.
Love having my hair dryer so handy.
good quality and lasts a long time...
This hairdryer with the brush attachment works very well for drying and straightening out curly hair. A must for everyone with these extra curls! It's also quite nice to have the availability of the two currents that one might use built into this one unit. It will be great for traveling to Europe.
Love this hair dryer!
Fantastic product and A++ transaction. I use mine evey day. Worth every penny.!!!!
Best and fast
good! cheap!
Fast shipping. Works wonderful for my curls.  My perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away.  I highly recommend this.
Works as intended. No problems. This is replacing another just like it that we had and it lasted 7+ years. Can't ask for much more for a blow dryer in this price range.
fast delivery great little travel item for me and use it to seal windows plastic liners in winter. Price is excellent.
Silent, hot, and lightweight! So far so good. Very pleased at the price top!
Return is no longer needed
Nice velocity and doesn't get too hot.  Cold button a good feature.
as described
LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.. DRIES MY HAIR FAST AND LEAVES IT SMOOTH W NO NEED TO IRON IT.. LOVE DIFFERENT TEMP SETTINGS AND DEFINATELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.. MY  STYLIST OWNS THIS SAME ONE AND SAID THEY LAST A VERY VERY LONG TIME. LOVE IT..WOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT AGAIN IF I HAD TO.
Love the air pressure on this dryer!
I purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage, and I wished to use it in both the United Kingdom and France.  It has an American plug, but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully!  I could not be happier with this purchase.  Turns out we went to Italy too, and with the same French convertor, the dryer worked in Italy too.
I would recommend this product - compact and powerful - worth for money
works well. Shipping was spot on.
love it love the arrival time as well.
been using this brand in my bathrooms for years.  easy to install.
Bought this for limited use to seal windows, having never purchased one before. It worked great.
This is a great item my college age daughter loves it
Awesome
It works great! The dial for timing it's backwards but it works just fine.
I used to spend six hours doing my girls' naturally coily and kinky hair. Drying time has now been cut to an average if five minutes, which in turns means a styling time of two hours total on the girls. This dryer gave me my weekends back. Only down side is that the ones I've had go out after roughly two years. I'm on my third t3 since 2011.
Best hair dryer I have ever had.
Works great!
very compact. Ideal for traveling.
I wanted a salon quality dryer and got it!  This dryer is fast, easy to work with, not too heavy and does a fantastic job.  Best I've ever owned.
great buy
works well, good ppwer, nice size for travel. would recommend it.
Great
great value
Was not the red one I wanted, but is sufficient.
I bought this hair dryer for my mother. She is a hair stylist and swears by it. She says it takes up no space and very convenient when mounted on the wall. Works just as good as any other blow dryer she's used. Great space saver.
Small enough to travel but powerful, I like it better than my regular Revlon I was using for 3 years.
Worked great in Germany and the UK.  Just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas.  Lightweight.  Low setying is powerful.  Highly recommend.
Wife loves it!
Was looking for a family hair dryer. Got a great deal and works good.  We also like the color.
My mom is a cosmetologist & has always supplied me with professional grade dryers for my thick, heavy hair. This one works better than any other professional dryer I have tried. The cost was more reasonable too.
The hair dryer works as expected.
With three teenage girls in the house, the hair dryer gets a lot of use. A LOT OF USE. We've blown through quite a few hairdryers - no pun intended. This one however, seems to be the clear winner. As a stylishly bald man, I can't personally vouch for it, but the female testimonials are unanimous... this is an excellent product.<br /><br />Full disclosure: the dog isn't a big fan, but she doesn't like baths much either, so can'r be surprised.
Love, love, love this hair dryer!  I've been looking (and trying) for months now! I finally found the perfect one for me!  YEAH! It's lightweight, small enough to travel and powerful. So easy to use. Economical, too!  I'm going to buy another one for the guest bath!  It's hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel. For some reason Conair puts &#34;1875&#34; on most ALL their dryers, so it's hard to tell the actual model number when you find one that you like...  Glad we were finally able to track this one down!
I bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire. I choose this one because I know the Babyliss name and I loved the pattern. The pattern IS actually as cute as it looks in the picture.<br /><br />Weight: This dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser. It feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break.<br /><br />Design: The cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy. It became easier to wrangle when I bought Velcro ties for the cord (On Amazon: VELCRO Brand - ONE-WRAP Thin Self-Gripping Cable Ties: Reusable, Light Duty - 8&#34; x 1/2&#34; Ties, 100 Pack - Black)<br /><br />Speed of drying: I can't say much here. After all, it is just blowing hot air, but I guess that I can say that it dries quickly.<br /><br />Temperature: The hot setting gets pretty hot. Not hot enough to burn your scalp, but hot enough to get the job done.
I love this dryer. I use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer. It's just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk. I'm seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.
dryers my hair super fast and no frizz
Just love it , freedom from the hooded dryer !
Great dryer makes my hair feel like silk
Great size and does a good job. The detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off (at least mine was) so consider whether you will take it off and on often.
I will now be saving money by going less to my hairstylist. This blowdryer dried my hair 2x faster than a previous blowdryer I had.  I wished I had bought this blowdryer years ago!
Best hair dryer I've ever owned.  I'm very happy with the quality of the product.
I've been looking for a good deal on a hair dryer for weeks and finally came across this one. Great purchase.
Fantastic Hair Dryer
Love it!!!
It dray my hair so quickly. Blow hot air.
Great product
EXCELLENT
Very good product
I was actually looking for something else when I stumbled upon this and thought &#34;why not&#34;.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have fine shoulder length hair and it did not take an hour to dry, as another reviewer stated.  (Of course, I didn't attempt to dry my hair when it is dripping wet either.  I wrap my hair in a towel and do other things for a while before attempting to blow dry.)  Anyway, I was worried at first because the packaging and most of the instructions are in Japanese.  But I used it on the lower voltage and it was fine.  I used the regular brush to dry my hair, as I'm not sure how to use the round brush yet.  I dried most of my hair and then used this upside down to give my hair some lift and bounce, which it did.  Also, my hair does not look frizzy, like it does at times when using a regular blow dryer (I believe because sometimes a regular blow dryer both damages and tends to tangle your hair).  My hair actually looks shiny as well as smooth (as if I flat ironed it).  I would give this a try if you are someone who likes the look of their hair when it is blow dried and/or flat ironed but with what seems much less damage.  I think you could get away with using just this dryer and a little serum (depending on how naturally straight your hair is). I am excited to use this and try to figure out the round brush too.
Works very well thus far.
I am small with shoulder problems and this is very compact and light weight.  It packs a punch with power!
excellent item
Does what its suppose to do, like the ability to clean it.
Very good
Love this hair dryer. Dries my hair in no time
The Nano technology is great. Blow dry is much faster than regular product. Keep my hair style nice (no dryness).
I'm  in love with this hair dryer It's small but really dry's my hair fast and does a wonderful job.
it took me a while to find a blow dryer that actually made it easier to do my hair , usually my hair would still be super fluffy and still kind of tangled after blow drying . I have really kinky curls and after using this my hair was almost straight . I only used a flat iron so it would be sleek but this blow dryer really works . it made my hair shiny and straight and it gets really hot which helps a great deal. I totally recommend this blow dryer to anyone especially if you have kinky curly hair like my self .
I had one before and I love it.  It's off the counter and out of the way.
Dries really fast. I have to use a brush and brush my hair while using this dryer or else it is just an odd mess. I live in area with high humidity off the Gulf coast and my hair stays flat all day! Even straighter than my straight haired friends. I do have to use another dryer when I want to wear my curls because this dryer takes them out.
Works great.
i love the cord keeper Conair dryers.  Much easier to store.  My old Conair cord keeper (less expensive, 2 speed, 2 heat settings) wore out at the plug.  Couldn't be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty Amazon.  I saw this model and read the reviews.  I liked that it had a cool setting and didn't have to keep,the button pushed for the cool shot.  I also like that it has the cord keeper.  But the best feature about it, in my opinion, is that it is MUCH QUIETER than the less expensive model.  I get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum, compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes.  If a quieter blow dryer is what you're looking for, with 1875 power, this is your dryer.  Worth the extra money!!!  Buy it, you won't be sorry!  Super fast delivery!  Ps, use the concentrator nozzle, cuts down on frizz.
Exceeded my expectations.
This hair dryer met all of my expectations. I love its compact design. The bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers, and on the medium heat setting it gets warm enough to dry my hair in 10 minutes. I think it's a quality product with a thoughtful design.
Works great! Night light still works and we've had it over a year!
Love it. It fits on the wall and it's out of the way. Nite lite is bright also
Bought one of these for a spare bedroom when we have guests. Took a shower in there one day and LOVED this so much I threw mine away and bought one for myself too.
The vulcano of hair dryers
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
so far so good.  My husband ordered it, but we both use it.  Have had a similar  one before and used it for years.<br />Hoping this one last as long.
Great!
I love this dryer
Cheap and enough for normal use.
Good Product
Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products. I am so glad that I went with this one because it is the best hair dryer I have ever had!! Ever!! I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better. It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy. And that is not all. I use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair!. I use to use a product that suppose to help lift the roots and I hated because that product was smelly and It really wasn't doing much , but now this amazing hair dryer makes my hair look healthy and even fuller because of the lift.<br />I LOVE IT!.
As always, the Oster Wall Hair Dryer is convenient and I am satisfied. Although, my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller.
This blow dryer is great . I use it all the time.  Mainly on extensions.  Have not tried it on natural hair (4a-4c) yet.  It should be fine.  Makes drying my hair so much faster and easier
just what I wonted. love it I can move around and sleep in it.
Excellent and efficient.
Really good product.
It is good.
I needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer, and this one not only fit but also works well.  With 1875 Watts, it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting.  The handle folds to make it more compact for storage.<br /><br />This is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds, high and low, and one temperature unless you hold down the &#34;cool&#34; button at the top of the handle.  It doesn't have the bells and whistles of more expensive models -- no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades.  The handle has a switch to convert from 125 V to 250 V, and you MUST know the voltage of the country you're visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire.  Remember to change it back when you get home.  A few countries, however, use lower voltages than 125: many Caribbean countries, Japan, Taiwan, and a few South American countries.  Check your destination before you go.  The hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100-250 V.  It would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do; however, I've never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer.<br /><br />On American current, this is a powerful little hair dryer.  Although most hotels supply hair dryers these days, it works well for those times when either you're not sure you'll find one and when you want to depend on something you know.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
I like it
thanks
Great hair dryer. Drys hair quickly and without allot of noise
I have fine hair but A LOT of it and normally takes me over an hour to blow dry my hair.  My hairstylist uses this on my hair and it cuts the drying time in half, so I purchased one to use at home. I don't know what I would do without it!
A must have for any girl! It really has revolutionized hair dryers and I gotta admit I have owned a ton! The drying time is crazy fast! Truly one of my best purchases I have made on amazon! ðŸ˜‰<br />THANKS AMAZON!
I like how big the diffuser head is.
Very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair.  It's not too heavy nor too loud.  All in all, I would recommend this product!!
This thing has so much power, it will nearly blow the hair right off your head!!!  :)
My previous yellow bird lasted over 12 years.  Great for curly stubborn hair.  A real workhorse!  Product was delivered within 2 days.
Great product.  Cuts dry time in half when compared to other dryers.  Purchased my own and when my daughter borrowed it she loved it so I ordered another for her as a gift.  Great product at a reasonable price.
Great
Takes 2 hours to dry, but easier to sit under than the hard hat dryers! My hair is thick shoulder length and I use the jumbo pink rollers to set.
This dryer has alot of power,,different heating settings,,,i was just use to one! Well worth the money,,i have looked around and this is cheaper and a better product! Well worth buying
I have extremely thick hair. It typically takes 30 minutes to dry it all. I have been able to dry my hair within 5-10 minutes with this dryer. The concentrator helps reduce frizz from my frizzy hair and makes it easier to straighten. I have yet to use the diffuser but it's amazing overall!!
Nice design and the night light is an added bonus.
great dryer, and very cheap too!
Love it!  Definitely a salon-style dryer; so much faster on my thick hair than conventional dryers.
This is perfect for curly hair. The difuser piece gets popped in when you receive it and it does not fall out! Its there to stay. I love this product!
I love it!!!
I have had the Remington blow dryer for 5 years but unfortunately I left it at my daughters home.  I have called a few times to get her to ship it back but she keeps forgetting so I bought another.  Love it just as well as my older one and looks the same except for color.  Found out my daughter loved the blow dryer which is why she kept forgetting to mail it back to me.  We both would recommend this hair blower....especially if you have thick hair like we do.  It works great.
The retractable cord is awesome and the airflow is good. Very nice product.
I was definitely skeptical of paying this much for a hair dryer, especially one with a brand that I have never even heard of making hair dryers.  But the reviews were good so I decided I'd give it a try. I had really high expectations and they were definitely met! I LOVE this hair dryer. I have wavy/curly hair and usually when I blow dry it, it gets really frizzy, this blow dryer gets rid of at least 75% of that friziness, if not more. And the diffuser it comes with is amazing! Another plus, is that it is soooo much quieter than any other blow dryer I've ever had!!
This is absolutely the BEST hand hair dryer I have every had.  I have 4B hair/natural,  and it dries my hair in less time and straight!  You will not go wrong with this
We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.<br />If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.
Why wasn't I using a remington before. These are way better than the one I was using before from Revlon.<br /><br />10 stars.
Picked this out after using it in a hotel. I've had it in 3 or 4 hotels since then. It has a Medium speed which is rare, and the Cool setting, which I love. And it was reasonably priced!
love it
Very nice and lighter weight than previous models.  Dries well.
Love this blowdryer- don't like how the nozzle on the front pops off on it's own, but it has reduced frizz.
Quality hair dryer, this really moves some air.
Great product,looks and preformance.
When we got this hair dryer we wanted one that wouldn't cause fly away hair. This certainly lives up to the claims. Also this dryer has individual controls for speed and heat. I really like that, because most of the time I don't need high heat but do want more blowing power. It also isn't very noisy as far as hair dryers go.
It works great.
Best blow dry ever, I have been buying these for years ..
Good product for an amazing price!
Great hair dryer. Dries my hair great for thick hair.
This is my second time buying this hair blower. I love it so much!
I travel frequently and love this hairdryer because the dual voltage allows me to use it anywhere and it is light to handle and small to pack in my luggage.
Arrived ahead of schedule, good price.
Small, easy to mount.  Does the job
just what we wanted. size is great and very compact.
Love it and use it daily.  So convenient.
Where has this been my whole life?!?? This is honestly the best hair dryer ever.
Very good. Pleasantly surprise
This dryer is awesome, the accessory allows me to pinpoint a section of hair for styling/drying purposes and has a cool setting which sets the style in place, handle does not fold in but luckily I have drawer space.
Excellent!
excellent product, very good at relationship between Quality vs Price, recommended 100%
is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected
Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.
Good
Great hairdryer and very quiet!
So far, I like this hair dryer.  It is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time.
Great, love it
Good hairdryer!
Two buttons means you can control the fan speed and temperature -independently- which is a very good thing.  This is a good hair dryer, better than the discount store cheapies--but it is a good price, and good quality too.  Highly recommended.
this is the best!!! works great for hair! annnd my hubby decided to use it to take decals off our truck.... he used it for 4 hrs straight on high heat and i was a bit nervous it would die out on me pretty quick afterward but its 4 mos later and still as good as when i bought it!! very happy with this product!!
This was a birthday present for my long-haired daughter and she loves it.
I had this blow dryer before but i dropped it had to get another one. And i luv it
My wife like the power and size.  I think it is a bit loud.  Easy to mount and it doesn't take up much space.
Great power.  I shouldn't have waited so long to purchase it.  Dries hair more quickly than any other dryer - by far!  Worth the extra money.
Great blow dryer definitely better then I was expecting
Bought for a present..was well liked!
Great for traveling. It takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing!
I decided to purchase this hair dryer after using it during a recent hotel stay.  I was drawn to the fact that it does not emanate the same high-pitched tone that my prior Conair makes (which is also an 1875 but has added features such as cool air and turbo settings).  I'm very happy with my purchase.  The hair dryer is VERY lightweight, cheap, and hot enough to get the job done.  Most importantly to me, I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when I use it.  I highly recommend it.
Excellent dryer for the price! I've owned Hot Tools and other Conair dryers in the past, and so far this one has been the best. I bought this one to replace my older model Conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use. I really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting, rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast (although it still has that button as an option). It's not as quiet as my last dryer, but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static. My hair actually looks more shiny/silky after using this one than it did with the older model.
Excellent produce
Nice
awesome
The best wall mounted dryer I've found!  I also love the little night light as it's enough to light my way to the bathroom at night!
Way better than my previous dryer. I was cheap. I was trying to save money for a while... in the worst ways possible. I ended up buying this $11 dryer because it was cheap.  And for a year, I went around with wet hair. I tried to tell myself that it was okay because of all the money I was saving. But it did not feel okay. I finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day. This dryer works so quickly. It makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all. It will dry hair quickly and efficiently.  I do not use any of the attachments that come with it. But if you style your hair, just know, those are options too.
I love the item. It has become very much easier to dry my dreds. Thank you!
I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend. I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.
The best dryer ever, I go through hair dryers like crazy, finally I have found one I love!
Perfect size for travel but still really powerful.
Good
Love this.
my home use blower. works well!
Looks and works great
Drys my hair fast and effectively:)
i had a &#34;professional&#34; hair dryer and it broke, i picked this one based on the reviews and the price and i love it. it takes me 15 min to dry my medium hair and it doesnt cause a lot of frizz.
I like the silky feel this hair dryer gives my hair.  I bought the same kind to replace an old one.
Great dryer, convenient wall access
Great for blowouts!!!
I looooove looooove this hair dryer.  It's lightweight and has cut my drying time in HALF!
Best hairdryer ever!
I had on of these for 12 years.  It finally gave up the ghost.  Works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall.  Added bonus - more wattage with the new one!
Amazing
WORKS WELL
This hair dryer works super well. I don't find the sound level much different from other hair dryers as some have complained. I appreciate all of the different settings (3 heat settings, Hi/Med/Low power, and teh different Wattage rankings). The concentrater actually stays on the dryer, which is not what I have experienced in the past. Also, the cord retraction is not perfect; it sometimes  leaves an extra 6 inches out, but I actually find it better than other cord retraction models. Since it is a full size blow dryer, I don't expect it to be compact and the additional cord is a non-issue for me. Glad I happened upon this model.
Best blowdryer ever.  This is my second T3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage. Drys super fast and less damaging.
Love
just prefect for me.
works, retractable cord is nice
I have not had chance to use it allot, but so far so good :)
I purchased this for my vacation home.  I liked it so much I brought it home and took the more expensive dryer I was using at home to my vacation home.
As advertised, works great MUCH faster than my precious dryer. The buttons on the handle are a bit awkward but I'll get used to it.
ðŸ˜Š
I amd black and I have natural hair and I can tell you that this blowdryer will be perfect for anyone!
NO complaint. It is very powerful for the size.
I like this product
My daughter loves
Excellent product. Recommended.
i like
Arrived when it was supposed to. Dries my hair super fast. Nice feel to the dryer. Great price. What more can you ask for?
Dries my hair fast
I needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my BaByliss Pro TT.  The Remington works great.  Everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it.  Easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish.  The one item worth noting is that the Remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the BaByliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this hair dryer.
Very well made. Ergonomics is perfect. It has a dust filter that you can remove and clean out. The plug has a breaker switch. The main power switch is in the handle. This dryer can be used in a salon setting.
Just pyrchased this, but it works well.  Low is hot enough for thin hair.  Med is hor and Hot is super hot!  My old dryer similar to this lasted years.  We'll see about this one.
Great
Dries my extremely thick, long hair quickly.  I use leave-in conditioner, brush out with my Wet Brush and then use the comb attachment to dry.  It takes &#60;10 min.  This is unheard of for me.  Its also fairly quiet.  My friends are sick or hearing about it so, I thought I'd tell Amazonians... I really love this hair dryer!
This is a good hair dryer.  It's the 4th one that I've bought over several years.
Excellent. Small. No negatives.
I love that this comes with a little diffuser. For a little guy, it does a very good job.
exec
Second one i purchased for wife and daughter
good settings nice flow real smooth
Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well. For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it's job. Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments
Better than any hair dryer I have had. Great product.
It has several heat settings and several speeds.  The options are great!
Works like it should.
Looks great, works great, cord isn't too short (a pet peeve), and I love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days. I can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since I can change up the settings the moment it's a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction. Really liking the product so far. For me, Conair has always delivered.
Great product. Have used similar dryer for 20 years in 2 bathrooms. This model seems quieter but still has the power.
Love it! Small but powerful!
Love this dryer! Looks sharp, cut my hair drying time in half!
Good value, great price!
this has met all my expectations.  very happy with product
She loves it. It performs better than expected. Congrats on selling a GREAT product and thanks for asking.
My Revlon hair dryer started sparking and died in January, a few days after the one-year warranty expired (yay! not.) so I needed to find a quick replacement. I've been pleasantly surprised with this dryer so far! I have very thick hair that usually takes forever to dry, even with a dryer, but this one is nice and light and doesn't make my arm feel like it's going to snap off after holding it for a few minutes. Probably the smartest part of the design is the honeycomb pattern over the back--it's pretty much impossible for my hair to get through it and get stuck in the blades. That makes drying much easier, since I can move the dryer through my hair without worrying about sudden-onset baldness and pain.<br /><br />It's not too loud, and it's definitely quieter than my old dryer. My only minor complaint is that the nozzle (is that what it's called? the duckbill-looking thing that concentrates air) will occasionally fly off in the middle of drying. I'm not sure if that's force from the air, or from moving the dryer around, but it's not quite as secure as it could be. Other than that, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer--and the fun color is a plus, too!
It is beautiful, I ordered a white one, I really like this color!  The size is good and it has really nice design. I got it on time. I love it so much. It is easy to take!
I have long thick hair and it usually takes a long time to blow dry. Not with this dryer! It is the best one I ever had. I could not believe the price was so good. Love It!
Great buy for great price.
Love this product. Nifty compact is a plus. Can be taken anywhere. Use to steam or dry hair.
Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!<br />Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the 'upper 2'.
Really love the cold setting.
I have curly hair, this diffuser is perfect for getting curls to look defined without the frizz.
Wonderful product! I love it!
Works great and pretty color!
Great hair dryer.
Seem like package could have been shipped out sooner. But it arrived when promised. Great product & brand new. Used the dryer for 2 yrs up until my lil client touched it & it dropped. Had to duck tape it together for awhile until the new one arrived but it still worked wonders. LOVE, LOVE THIS DRYER!
Great size, and noise level.
As described,  works great.
I initially bought this for a vacation. Within a few days it would only blow cool air. Contacted Amazon who had Helen of Troy email me. They replaced it no questions asked and I didn't even have to send the new defective one back! But let me tell you this I LOVE! I use it every time I shower, not just for travel. It's smaller, but not on power, dries fast and the intake hasn't collected any dust like other dryers do. Has a few different power settings. along with the cool setting and I would recommend this in a heartbeat.
I was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews, however, this blow dryer is AMAZING!  I have VERY thick, course, wavy, shoulder length hair.  With traditional Conair blow-dryers from Walmart, I would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy.  I thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair.  Wrong.  With this dryer, it now takes me 3-4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen.  I almost cried the first time I used it.  Yes, if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons, however, to modify that I simply hold it higher up and have no problems.  When this one dies, I'm most definitely buying another.....especially at such a great discounted price!
Wonderful.
I love,
LOVE this hair dryer. It has great power and dries my hair rather quickly. Would highly recommend!
This gets a 5+ star in my book.  I've used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster, smoother, and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go.  It is so much better than my Conair that I had.  This is high end quality.
Bought for my wife. She says she loves it. No ten paragraph review needed here.
excellent good
Great little travel dryer. Works almost as good as a full size one.
You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer. I wanted something that had some power to it and couldn't find it at my local Target.  This is a great product. I have been practicing blow outs and its prefect for this.  So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.
First tried this at a Hyatt Hotel. Loved it and now I own my own. Great for travel or everyday use.
I had a really old hair dryer.  So this one to me is awesome!!  It's not too noisy and it dries my hair quickly.
Love it!!
Perfect!
best hairdryer
I LOVE this hair dryer!  I went on vacation and there was one in my room.  I loved it so much I came home and searched for it til I found it.  Amazon had the best price for this model.  When it came, I was not disappointed.  If you like your dryer to have a lot of force to it, this is the one.
It is a great space saver and it works very well.
Amazing.  Very short drying time with no frizz.
Best hair dryer ever
Great dryer.<br /><br />Has cut her hair drying time by 40% with better results!
Bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it. Powerful enough, not too noisy, takes up little space. It does exactly what you want from a travel dryer.
LOVE IT!!!!! Highly recommend it!!
Although the package was damaged on arrival the contents were intact.  This was replacement for an identical Conair unit that my Bride has used continually for several years.  We expect the new Conair to be as serviceable as the previous one.
This hair dryer is wonderful!
Fantastic bonnet drier. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get a quality product. I primarily use this when I am doing a deep treatment on my hair.
Love the small size.  Dries my hair very quickly and comes with a great travel bag.  It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.
I love this one! Great purchase. It drys my hair super fast!
I love this hair dryer!  The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one. The speed and heat buttons are 'user friendly' and the heavy cord is nice and long. Altho it's not quite as light as I'd imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn't consider it to be heavy or bulky and it's still quiet and powerful.  Good value for the money.
Great dryer, I use it to deep conditioner my hair.  I love the portability of this product.  This is a lot better than the bulky hooded dryer.
love this dryer,, it is my second one, but wish it lasted longer- first one was less than 2 yrs
This was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far.  When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny. Even my hubby thought my hair felt softer.  You ladies are doing great work and I thank Amazon for carrying your line of products.
Excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. With long thick hair I'd gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it. This dryer is not only lightweight and quieter than any dryer I've ever had but it also dries my hair in 5-6 min. That's from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don't even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained. With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must. So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.
it doesnt damage the hair like the other dryers ive tried and its very lightweight
does the job right
I've been very happy with this so far.  It's very light, and I love that it has three heat (one being no heat) settings and two speed settings, which is more than most dryers have.  The airflow is pretty strong on the high setting.  The setting labels are already wearing off though, after only a few months of regular use.
wow!!! incredibly fast shipping from Mix Wholesale. I ordered it on Thursday..it arrived on Saturday (and I live in Georgia). put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up! So easy to assemble!! Can't wait to use this on my 4b/c natural hair!! will update again after more use.<br /><br />Update: This dryer is fantastic!! Dried my freshly washed, dense, chin length 4b/c hair in about 40 minutes! on medium heat!! I did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all. I have a pic of the size rollers I used; they fit with AMPLE space under the hood. It's also very quiet--I had no trouble having a conversation on my phone; easily watched television. I haven't had to duct tape anything, it's pretty sturdy, a little wobbly, but not I'm not moving around a lot if I'm sitting under the dryer anyway..<br /><br />Basically, I love it and I'm SO GLAD i didn't waste my money on a Pibb or PEBCO brand. I don't own a salon, but it's great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer.
Works great, mounts nice!
best blowdryer! Love it! Recommended by my hair stylist and its amazing!
Great used this for my aunts salon, cheap but works like its an expensive dyer
I love this hair dryer.  It is so easy to use.  And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  Great for all seniors!!
This product had great reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. Turns out it's the BEST blowdryer! It's lightweight and dries in a very short amount of time.
good job
exelente
good hair dryer works well
Wind is strong and does not feel too hot. Get hairs dry quickly. Love this product.
Love this.  I dropped my previous one, different brand, and had to replace it.  The cord-keeper part is the main feature for me.  The hair dryer itself works fine, a little louder than most but is also more lightweight than most.  Love it!
it an excelent  product
I bought it for my maine coon cat. He likes this dryer.
Great!!!
good
This is the best hair dryer.  It is my second one.  I had the first one for years and when it finally broke, I tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the Conair 1875.  The cord keeper is a great feature for me, since I keep the dyer in a drawer.  It stays in there compactly.
Use it every time I wash my hair. Pretty good. It's been a while, works without problem.
This was installed in a RV on the wall of the bathroom area. The unit is plugged into a 110 volt GFCI outlet and the night light and unit power can be turned on/off by pressing the GFCI button. The night light is good - not too bright but ample. The unit appears to offer good air flow and not being too noisy. I am happy with the performance, looks and operation so far.
My daughter loves the color pink so I had to get it. Simple speeds as a standard hair dryer.
Love it. Does a good. Hot enough. Diffuser is a bonus.
Just started usingðŸ˜ðŸ˜€
i love it
Amazing product works great for naturally curly hair!
It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.
I love this blow drier. Cut my blow dry time in half. I bought the leopard/cheetah print one. The price on this item has changed significantly, unfortunately. When I purchased, this dryer was significantly less expensive than other colors of the same model. Before ordering and receiving I was concerned it was a knock off because it was cheaper than the other two color options. I do think it is real. It works well. Feels well made. I looked at all of the instructions closely on the box for spelling/grammar mistakes which are common with fakes and found none. I've had about 2 months now and it works well. I also had one of my good friends look at it closely. She is a cosmetologist and currently works at a salon that sells this brand. She said it looked authentic to her.
This hair dryer is top quality and I love it. Dries my hair quickly, is light weight and works great. Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast. Best dryer I have ever owned so far.
Love it, has 3 settings and cool, warm and hot for drying hair. Works very nice. And low, med and high also.
LOVE IT!
love it!
Arrived soooo fast made me very happy!!!!!! and the dryer it self is fantastic.
Love it. Recieved it quickly. Dries really fast. Only down side is that it vibrates leaving my hand tingly. But its awesome.
Quiet yet efficient.
The only con is the weight. It's pretty heavy but it works perfectly.
works as expected.  Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  Keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small.  Small but quite powerful.
I have owned one of these dryers in the past, and found it like many others.. in a hotel bathroom. Great dryer. Very affordable. I accidentally broke mine dropping it down an entire flight of stairs. Just replaced even cheaper than I purchased it for 5 years ago.
BEST HAIR DRYER, VERY HAPPY
Excellent! I am so glad I bought this. Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. A really good and worthwhile purchase! Just want to say I am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago! It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days. I could not be happier with this product. I've been around for a &#34;while&#34; and no other hair dry has ever come close. Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I'm on my way! Love it!!!
Great hair dryer, nicely balanced, good air flow, and not too loud. This is one appliance I hate having to replace, as you get so accustomed to one, but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite. Dual heat & speed controls are a must for me. Nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments.
Exactly as described
I never ever write reviews for products, but with this I had to!! It's that amazing. My hair is very thick, and blowdrying my hair with this dryer is faster and easier than I ever could have imagined. You know that amazing feeling you get when you've just gone to a salon? That's what your hair is like every time you use this dryer. 100% worth the money.
good heat
Good dryer, lightweight & works well. 2 speeds.
Very good blow dryer! I usually buy very cheap ones but splurged a little this time. Love it! It is a little heavier than I'm used to.
Excellent in every way , I really like this.<br />My favorite by far
good product
I couldn't find good for my hair any. Only this one I use about 2-3 years already, and still have it as a gift for my mom.<br />Highly recommended item!
very nice!
Exactly like photo. Delivered fast. Great price.
I am very happy with this product. It dries fast! It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there. This is salon quality!!
I have had this hair dryer for a week and I love it! I can dry my hair in under 10mins. The attachment allows you to put the dryer on your hair which speeds up the drying time. I have thin but long hair and I'm amazed at how quickly it dries my hair.
good power
Works great arrived on time.
Just like my old one.  I love it.
I love this! Great!
Love this hair dryer. So glad i got it. Also, i live what the company stands for.
Best blow dryer ever...you can feel the quality as soon as you pick it up...performance=none better...worth every penny.
I love this hair dryer!  It is quieter than my older Conair.  It has nice speed/temperature settings that blow dry quickly without as much damage. I can dry my below shoulder length hair with the medium heat/air setting in less than 10 minutes. My hair is soft and easy to style, plus attachments stay on tight. I will buy Remington from now on.
This hairdryer is perfect for thick hair. The handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes, so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes. Great design.
Dries my hair fast and isn't very loud. Absolutely love it! Thank you so much!
Perfect replaced old one I was very pleased with.
Hair dryer works great
When I first turned this product on my hair was wet. When I turned this device off my hair was dry.<br /><br />I purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available. It worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product. I have been very happy so far.
Quiet and quick. My old hairdryer was a screamer and I got this one because I was developing tinnitus and everything I read suggested controlling decibels was important.  The buttons are right where you grip the handle, so it takes a little getting used to placing fingers so you're not changing your settings.  My hair is smoother.
Perfect for my needs!
I spent a very long time waiting for the right deal on an ionic hair dryer and this was the first time in at least 6 months that I saw what I was looking for with an appealing price tag. I took the plunge and bought it and have been VERY happy with the results. My hair turns out very smooth and is even shiny after I use it. The clip on accessory is amazing for focusing the air stream and definitely helps with minimizing frizz. It is also very pretty. :)
Everything is working well. No problems after a month. Happy with everything.
Awesome product.. I would recommend it to anyone
met my expectations.
Works as well as the expensive ones. Super price.
Love this hair dryer.  Had an older one for years, it finally died so I replaced it with this newer version.
I would definitely buy this again. I had an older model for years that we traveled with and it finally wore out.
Great little hairdryer - especially for travel.
The best hair dryer ever!
Works great and light to handle
This dryer dries my hair quickly, leaving it smooth and shiny.  And my hair requires less touching up on the second day.
Great hair dryer.  Fast and hot.  Good quality product.
Okay, I have fine hair so my hair doesn't take that long to dry.....I can have my hair dry/styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat.  Great dryer with a nice leopard pattern.
Great Hairdryer
el producto es muy bueno<br />the product is very good
Works really well! Only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying.
Very good article! i have 4C natural hair and I use the large comb to make the blow dry, wonderful! i'm in love<br />I leave in france and the article was well packed
Excellent product! Powerful and light weight..I love it!!!
I have thick, long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist. It is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything I have bought before.  I would highly recommend this.
Love it!
Bought for my son and he loves it and uses it every day.  Not too loud which is great.
Works better than expected
I absolutely love this hair dryer. My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.
I love this blow dryer.  It dries my hair, which is very thick in very little time.  High quality, especially compared to the blow dryers you can buy in the local market.
After 12 years, my old (exactly the same) dryer died - it didn't owe me a thing.  I was pleased to find the same design still available.  We have a small bathroom so I don't have the space to leave a dryer on a counter, and I'm certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use.  This is so darn convenient!
great dryer-----love the diffuser that comes with it.  Not too expensive and it's lightweight and compact.  very highly recommend
Super powerful, blows a lot of air.  I had a much more expensive hairdryer that was almost double the price for the past 6 years before this one and this one is even more powerful than my old one.  I need a strong hairdryer b/c I have very thick hair.  Just to give you an idea, wall mounted hair dryers at hotels are totally useless to me.  If I plan to dry my hair while traveling, I have to bring one.  This one comes with a bunch of different attachments.  And I like the animal print (although my husband does not but that print was much cheaper for some reason than the solid color ones)
Whoa...amazing what a difference this hair dryer makes ! Ive owned many, none that compare to this ! No more uncontrollable or fly away hair !  Its like magic ! The best ive owned !!!
Nothing fancy. Works well for the price. Good value for money.
good
Works great.  I have thick hair and it dries really quickly with this hair dryer.
I love my dryer!
love it wish it had a comb for naturals but it's worth it . great blow out Everytime
Delivery was on time! I They are so easy and light to handle. Just what I was looking for.<br />Thanks so much!!
love it! heavy and durable hair dryer
Super hot and really nice to use.  Serves its purpose, what more could I ask!?
I love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings. The band on the bonnet is tight at first, but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable. I cover my ears with Wrapp-it bands when drying. The carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses.
This was a replacement for the same unit we'd had for years.  Just a simple snap-in installation.  Great product at a great price.
Love this hairdryer! I've had maybe 5 or 6 of them. Mostly they only die when I drop them on the floor. I love the fact that the new one fits the wall mount from the last one and I didn't have to make new holes in my wallpaper! It's a great little hairdryer and not expensive.
Convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer. No fumbling under the sink or closet. Available when I want it!
Good, basic dryer. Liking it a lot.
great hair dryer
This dryer is amazing I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow! Love it!
I have been using this brand and dryer for 10 years now.  They last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying.  Its gets the job done great for keratin treatments too
Works great, wife happy
Works as expected
I couldn't live without it!
Excellent seller, good product, was exactly what I ordered, arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly, thanks
Works very well so far.  Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.<br />I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.<br />Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.<br />Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &#34;hidden&#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.
I absolutely love this dryer! I was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it's well worth the money. I have curly, color treated hair and I definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one. My hair feels healthy, smoother...as if I just came back from the salon! Great product!
Best hairdryer on the market. Not too loud and dries hair fast. I should have bought 2
Cut my drying time in half!! Love it :)
I love this hairdryer, so lightweight and my hair is great.  It really does make a difference to have a great hairdryer.
Better than expected.
What can you say about a hairdryer? It dries my hair nicely lol. It doesn't get as hot as I expected, like my last one did. But it's a nice hairdryer for the price!
all excellent, recommended 100%
Perfect. Just what I wanted. Fast delivery!
Great dryer, it's fast and it was a great buy.
Used this at a hotel and had to have it!  Best hair dryer I ever used.
A great lightweight product, easily stored on a shelf.  I bought it to heat process my hair color, and it does the trick.
very good product. Love it. 5 stars
Great product!
Works great.  No complaints.  Fyi: I'm 28 & never owned a hair dryer before so I dont have anything to compare it to.  BTW If you think it this product sucks, it doesn't; it blows.
nice hair dryer
Item was the exact item as seem on the pictures. Came with all three extra pieces for blowing out the hair. Use it recently n it was good......I must say its very hot.  Good tool. Its just to see how long it will last. But no regrets in this purchase n I'm loving my dryer
Great appliance for the price.
Have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died, I purchased this one.  Have had it a few months now and absolutely love it.  It is the only dryer I have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings. It's mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks.
i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday. she's very happy with the product. thank you
wife loves it
very good
I love this hair dryer! It comes with two attachments which help keep the heat damage to hair at a minimum. The design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. It heats evenly and does a fantastic job. It is high quality for a great price. I recommend this product.
Great Purchase!!
amazing
AMAZING!
love the product great service
Love this hairdryer so much I have an extra one in my guest bathroom!
wooooooooooow !!!!!  This baby dries hair in a blink of an eye.  I am a cosmetologist and Blowouts / Blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10-15 minutes, (in a salon, this means more clients and more money).  I told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more.  Hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while.    Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.
This is a great hairdryer. Very pleased, even if it is a slight pink.
Great blow dryer!  Does a wonderful job. Will not buy another brand.
This is a great unit. Compact put full of power.  I wish this was the standard unit used by hotels.  Highly recommended.
XTAVA Rimini iconic hair dryer.is 1800 w .which is perfect for extremely good results for styling and drying your hair with in short period of time.it helps ur hair hair from getting frizzier and more dry looking by different speed for air blow and two power buttons .also contains two attachments.which can be used for focussed precise area u need to style or dry .without affecting the remaining part of the hair.after using the second attachment I am surprised to see the difference in my hair as it looks more shinier and don't forget to use the cool feature after you done drying your hair it gives such a finished look to the hair keeping it more natural and free flowing.i have tried other XTAVA PRODUCTS too like allure and i must say XTAVA. Products have proffessional results got excellent motor .safe to be used by urself and economical in price with all the required features .i will definetly recommend this without any hesitation
I did my research before buying a new hairdryer and this one fits the bill without having to spend $1-200.  It works well
Excellent
the quality of this dryer is outstanding! I will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons...A+ðŸ˜‰
Second one of this week, works great.
Fast shipping and undamaged.
This hairdryer is light yet powerful.  My first one lasted over 15 years, I'm hoping this one lasts as long or longer!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. It's super cute, sleek and looks professional. It has a lot of functions and it drys my hair fast.
Exactly as expected. Good value.
VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro's want .... A very well made product that is built to last ... I give it the highest rating.
This works very well.  It's my second Conair, and I think I will enjoy using it.
powerful and adjustable
Nice product.....works great
I really needed a new dryer and I'm glad I picked this one! It has great power and I like the folding handle.
My wife is very happy!!
I absolutely love this hair dryer. I did a lot of research as to what people where saying was the best hair dryer nowdays and it consistenly showed this one! I love the high pressure and the different settings. My hair is silky and definitely not frizzy by the end of a hair drying session. :)
works great. abundant heat. quieter than its predecessor.
Wife loves it!
This hairdryer is great. I bought it because we recently moved and I couldn't find my hairdryer in the sea of boxes. ( I've had mine a long time so it was also a good excuse to get a new one.) I have fine thin hair. This hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that I really need. I'm very happy with my purchase. I realize now how lousy my old dryer is.
Now This is what u call a blow dryer
The collapsible handle, the stow away cord, the power of the motor, all these features make this hair dryer really great. Price was right, too!  Highly recommend!
Substantial and stylish. Works well.
So far so good. Powerful. Does make my thin hair look more volumn.
This midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer. I LOVE it! I have layered, waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly. The Volare V2 dries my hair smooth and silky. I've been using Sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair. V2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow, and the cool temp actually blows cool air. My hair dries and styles faster with the V2 than the Sedu. Made in Italy. Four year warranty. My search for the perfect dryer is over.
Really great product for the money!
My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!
By far the best hair dryer I've used and for the price is definitely worth getting one of these bad boys!  Make sure to clean the back every now and then just place against your vacuum hose to get excess hair and debris!
my all time favorite dryer!
Very happy
Great service, very nice blow dryer.
this hair dryer works very well. this a very inexpensive hair dryer and I have been told it will not last very long. i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut). i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on. most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter. once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair. this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job.
So far this hair dryer is great. Last year I purchased a conair one similar to this, and it seemed to over heat easily. I like the fact that this one has a low,medium, and high setting. The attachments that came with it are pretty good. I know a lot of people were complaining about the brush being too soft,  and I can see why they say that. Fortunately my hair isn't that thick, so the soft brush works fine for me.
It works really well!  best thing I have bought so far!
muy bueno
Love it.. small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time.
works
Good
exelente
Best blowdryer.Hair will be dry in record time. Only wish the concentration nozzle was permanently attached.
For the price, you can't beat it. Simple to use - no adjustments beyond &#34; Low - Off - High. What more can a person want!
Bueno
I noticed less static in my hair after the first time of using! I also notice more body if I use moose. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer but I have no problem putting up with that if it makes my hair look better! I also thought the price was great compared to other dryers of its likeness.
this is a great dryer for my curly frizzy long hair. makes it smoothe
good
Love it!
Love it it dries my hair beautifully
Awesome
I like it, but it doesn't really sound like a normal hair dryer, it sounds more like a vacuum.
So far, so good!  Much better than my previous Hot Tools that blew up.  It is heavier, but dries my hair faster and with less tangles.
I have a vacation rental close to a nationally known hike/bike trail and many of my guests are here for recreational activity.  In 3 years, I've only had to replace one of these units and everybody seems to love them.
Wife likes very much. Been in use 3 months still going strong.
Favorite dryer ever!
Even though I just got this week, I used on both my daughters hair to blow out for the first time!!! I bought this because I remembered my former stylist using this tool on my hair years ago!  I saw the price and jumped on it!  It's not fancy but it has four settings from cool to high heat and if you know how to use a blow dryer properly then you should be fine!  Thanks Amazon for having st half the price as Walmart! :). Worked like s charm on my girls and I only used cool and warm heat! ;) they have lots of curly hair!
Comes in handy 4 travel or a quick fix it.
Will be perfect for Greece.  Just change setting to 220/250 and plug in to adapter.
I love this hairdryer! It dries my hair in well over HALF the time my old one did. The removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time. It's perfect, and it comes with a ton of attachments.
It is the best hair dryer!
Was as described and worked well.
I purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience.  This is the best dryer she's used thus far.  The price was amazing, less than half of what I almost paid locally.  Drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat, it dries hair in about 1/3 the time of others she's used.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
It is a very good item . Very easy  to switch on.. Perfect.
This replicates the same dryer I had for years but finally bit the dust.  Long time Conair buyer.
I had to have a hair dryer so I could dry my Silky Terrier's long fine hair after her bath. I needed a dryer that was lightweight because several years ago I hurt my hand and it's hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long. This is perfect. It's very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold. I love this hair dryer and don't mind using it, as it doesn't hurt my hand at all.
Love it. Now my hair looks like I just left the salon. Quick dry time and great sheen
I used this dryer while at a Renaissance Suites and loved it. When I returned home, I looked it up online and ordered it. I'm just as pleased with it as I was with the one at Renaissance Suites because it is lightweight, quiet, and efficient.
My wife loves it! Uses it ALL THE TIME! Thank you
nice
Best hair drier I have ever owned!
Wife loves it and says its one of the better dryers that she has used..
For how inexpensive this hair dryer was, I was a little worried about the  quality, but  this is a great hair dryer!  It is quality made, and actually the best hair dryer I have ever had! It dries the hair quickly without getting too hot, or too cold...It is Just right!
Great price, dries hair fast, great for winter days, lots of speed and heat options. Only the bilious orange color might be an issue.
Love this hairdryer! I have very thick hair and lots of it so it takes a long time to dry. But it takes less than five minutes with this hairdryer. There's one attachment that comes with it which diffuses the air wide and i use it to give more volume. I realized how miserable my drying experience was before this purchase. Well deserve 5 star rating!
I bought this hair dryer because I wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair. This dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair. Cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier.
super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  So much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more...very happy
Great item.  Lightweight.  Very effective at drying the hair.  Highly recommend!
i bought this item and got it today and i did my rollers and all and i just loveeee the way it works! its small & the hood is really big to put rollers . i feel like i just came out of the salon. money well spent !
My gf loves it. She says it does no damage to her hair and she uses no heat protection treatment.
dries quickly
exact replacement for what my wife has used for years
Power and great tangle proof retractable cord.
There's a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it's loud. Yes, it is loud. I don't use a hair dryer to style my hair I just want it to dry it as quickly as possible. I have long hair to my lower back, its (mostly) straight and very fine hair. I part my hair in the middle. Then turn it on to the highest speend and hot. I dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side- another 5 mins. This is the 3rd time I've bought this hair drier. The 1st one died when I dropped it. R.I.P. The second one just died after 5 years... It wouldn't heat up. 5 years for $20.. That's a good deal to me. If you're looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and (apparently) silently... continue looking. If you're looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10-15 mins (if you have thick hair) then this one could be it.
Wife loves it! Great bank for the buck!
Very happy so far, I haven't owned this very long but it seems to work very well, it has a lot of settings so I can always find what I need for my hair.
Great product, can't beat that price!
Best, most powerful blow dryer ever!
Works good
1 year and still works great!  Excellent buy
I love it, of course my husband used it before I did.  It does not burn me like other hair dryers, it does not frizz my thin hair.
Works Great!! I purchased this for my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves it:)
A great hairdryer. It seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones I've used in the past. The color is pretty too.
This blow dryer works great.  It never frizzes my hair and the temperature control settings are really nice! It is not too heavy and I can easily dry my long hair without getting a workout! I also really enjoy the color. Awesome product!
This dryer replaced our old one, which finally gave up the ghost.  It is powerful and easy to control with the dual thumb-controlled switch which regulates heat and fan speed.
They get very hot, love them.
Very pleased.
Works well. I have thin hair and it dries it quickly but I have body!
Funky wild color and works great on my curls!
bought this for my daughter she has no complaints
very strong and powerful hair dryer. a little bit heavy, but i don't mind.
has held up for over year now. i only use it about once a week though
ok
I have very long thick hair that is chemically straightened and high lighted. Usually I go through 2-3 hair dryers a year and never get my hair completely dry.... Until this dryer. It is AMAZING!!! Normally it takes 30-45 minutes for it to be somewhat dry -but not with this dryer. My hair was COMPLETELY dry in 15 minutes. Save yourself time and money and buy this dryer. My only regret is not buying it sooner! Great price and will definitely buy another to have as a spare.
LOVE THIS! I have 4c hair with a tendency to shrink almost 75%! This gets the job done! I also use this on my three daughters' hair, we all have 4a-4c with high shrinkage, and this is one tough dryer! The attachments hold on for dear life and still have not broken!
Very nice, lightweight, seems to dry hair quickly without frying it. so far very nice, but time will tell how long it will last. great value so far.
i am completely satisfied, i have a long, strong, thick hair, and it works for me as good as  the proffessional blowers i used to have. I just hope it last. I like it very much. Good price, very light, even the colors of this hair blower are nice and they delivered on time. Thanks.
One of the best dryer for this price range. I like cold wave.
My second one. Love it but only hope it lasts a lot longer than the first one I bought. First one slowly died. Started to shut off sooner and sooner during dryings. Took it apart and found that the fan was rubbing on the housing inside and wore and cracked the fan. Became unbalanced inside and the fan speed slowed down causing it to overheat and shut down constantly.  If I could have bought a new fan blade I could have fixed it.
I like it.
A vey nice hair dryer!
Compact, folds,  and has great power. This is my second one, I purchased it to leave at the beach condo.
This is truly the BEST blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals!!! Powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use.  LOVE this product:)
Light weight and very good heat control
Works great!
I've been using this for about a week now. I previously had a Revlon with retractable cord that still worked, but it was REALLY hot. I have oily hair, so I have to wash it pretty much daily. The heat was killing my long hair. I took a chance on this and I am really glad I did. Initially, I was disappointed, but I am glad I stuck with it.<br /><br />1) Power! It has almost too much power for someone with long hair, my hair was FLYING all over the place (it also tangles easily). I added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped.<br /><br />2) Heat! Yes, its not super hot -- but heat isn't good either! It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one. I think people notice the difference a lot at first, but it really will go away and you'll get used to it. It hasn't been an issue for me.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this blow dryer. I can't say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer, but it will be much healthier in the long run and that's something I appreciate more than speed. It definitely does not take a long time by any means though. I am happy I got it!
Totally diggin my hair dryer.  Gift from hubby!  Needed something quiet that didn't wake up the kids.  2 levels of speed (low works as well as high, just more quiet), 2 heat levels, ions can be on/off, cool blast button, small, light, love!!!
as advertised
Works great.
I like it but the lady of the house would like a smaller one easier to manuver
very good!!
It's a great hair dryer, light, fairly quiet.
Bought as a gift and my mom loves it.
Excellent very responsible
very powerful blowdryer but doesn't fry my hair
Fits my hair dryer perfect, love it!
fast shipping, A++++++++++
Fast shipping. Awesome blowdryer.
My curly hair, somewhat thick, used to take at least 30 min to dry (sectioning off and drying with a round brush). After that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out. This dryer dries my hair STRAIGHT without having to section it off. I don't even have to flat iron it afterwards!!!  It is smooth, straight, and frizz-less in under 10 min!  Amazing!  Will NEVER buy any other dryer!!
I bought it 3 months back. No problem at all. Serves well. Quickly dries my hair. I mostly use it in medium speed. It's a light weight dryer.
Love it. Have very long thick hair. Cut drying time almost in half. Did not frizz my hair as other dryers have in the past.
It is easy to use
Present for my mom and it's very good quality for price.
I'm so excited when I receive this item, and can't wait to try it. The product was shipped from Japan and took about 20 days to be delivered.
Very lightweight, so great for long uses.
Light weight yet dries hair fast
Has a 110 or 220 setting so it's perfect for worldwide travel. Works with a plug adapter. No converter needed.
Dries my super thick hair faster than any other hair dryer I've owned.
This is great product!
EXCELENTE
These work great for motor homes and any close bathroom location.
Love it so far. No complaints that I've come across
very good dryer, nice power, not as heavy as the reviews I read previously.
Great blow dryer for my getting my wavy hair smooth.
When you brake your arm or can't use your  arm/hand and you only have one good hand! This is the best choice out there for you!
Love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great.  It's the second one I've owned and I would buy an Oster again.
excellent
used in Italy and was great
High wattage drys hair very fast
This dryer is amazing!!! Used it for the first time today. Leaves hair very soft and no frizz. It is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer, but I love it!!!
Perfect!
I love this hair dryer!! I have long, thick  hair, and it only takes about 10 min to dry it!!! I used to spend about 25 min just drying my hair and another 15 min styling it. I've reduced that time to just 15 min. What's not to like?
It works and makes her happy: 5 stars.
Amazing! Gets hot and works perfectly. The price is right and this product will get plenty of usage. I'm in love ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
I am very pleased with this product and the price.<br /><br />I bought it so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great. Heat distributes throughout cap and it's easy to use and store.
works excellent
I bought this to use when travelling because of it's compact size. But it works so well I've been using it everyday.  The cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect -- not too hot and not too cool. I added the attachment and found it performs better with it on. Has great power and doesn't make my hair frizzy or staticy. The only complaint I have is the strong plastic smell when I first opened the box. I've used it for a week now and I don't smell it anymore. I really do love this hairdryer.
love it!
New to hair dryers but does everything it should and a bit more.
works great, looks cool
I have owned a couple of these hairdryers.  They work great for 3-4 years before they get noisy.  For the cost and the convenience it can not be beat.
Worth it! I'm so glad I listened to my hairdresser when he recommended this hair dryer. Obviously, he uses his multiple times each day and his lasts for years. It really did cut down my drying time. Only negative is the weight. I don't mind it as I'm using it - it's an other arm workout :) it's when I travel with it that makes me wish it was lighter. I'm always to the weight limit on my checked bags so this goes into my carry on and it's another workout! Still love it and would recommend it.
mi friend loved it
This dryer BY FAR IS THE BEST EVER!!!! I have really long hair extensions and they take FOREVER to dry, and after reading the reviews for this dryer I decided to try it because they say drying in half the time.<br />They weren't kidding, this dryer is AMAZING to say the least, I have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive; so do yourself a favor, purchase this dryer, you wont be sorry, it is truly the best! Even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent! Some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy, I'll share a secret...cheap dryers are superlight weight, but in all sincerity, this dryer is not heavy at all, so not sure why some reviews say this. The button placement was an issue when I read the reviews but decided to try it for myself, and what I personally found was, where I place my hand is at the bottom anyways, so it was a non issue for me. It's totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways, and if I didn't purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement, I would have missed out on the BEST DRYER EVER, and believe me, I have tried them all. And side note, it really does dry in half the time, which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button ; )
Works good .
I researched a LOT of hair dryers, wanting one that wasn't too noisy and that had BOTH temperature and fan settings-- Found it!! This is the one!! It wasn't as expensive as some that just seemed like more than I needed. It does the job I need it to, in a short amount of time, w/o frying my hair!  It's not the Large size so it fits easily in my suitcase and travels well. I love the matte finish, which keeps it from sliding off the counter-- just feels solid in my hand without being heavy!
Bought for my wife and she loves it.  No complaints
Even, fast drying
Favorite dryer!  Dries hair quickly!
Works great, absolutely love it!
It's a great hair dryer! I love it!
Great blow dryers!
I used this blow dryer while in Spain.  It worked wonderful!
Can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage I ever used.  A good compact hair dryer!
Excelente
I use this to travel internationally (so far just Denmark and Spain) and it worked fine with the European adapter. Just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it!
muy bueno
/Mounted well.  Looks and works great!
Love this quiet, efficient dryer!!
I love my light weight hair blower !  It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.<br />It has two heat settings. I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low<br />and it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair. I have very fine hair and lots of it so it is not easy to<br />dry. Oh, and my hair is long. This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hair<br />look like it belongs on a 30 year old. I'm 65. This wonderful blower has a lot to do with it !
This hair dryer is amazing- I just ordered another one for my daughter- She has super thick long hair and doesn't like to dry her hair because it takes too long- We just tested this hair dryer and literally her hair was dry within 10 minutes- Great product!
great so far -- It has great power and heat.
Great travel hair dryer
nice retractable cord
Love this dryer...for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level.
I liked working fine
Very light and has strong power
Just what I wanted
Nice & quiet
The product is great, exceeded my expectations, thanks! Will purchase brand again
I admit, I was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did!  I have noticed that if I use a<br />Higher speed than is recommended for my hair type, it doesn't make as much of a change but if I follow the proper instructions, my hair is soft<br />And shiny and the results are incredible!
Long lasting, and serves it purpose!!!!!
Great!
Works great and keeps the vanity uncluttered.
Very powerful.
Excellent.
Excellent. It's very easy to put together, it's not too loud actually I'm watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now! The bell is not too loud when the timer is done. The only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but I'm used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable. Delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent. My hair dried very quick and I didn't even put it on the max heat. I'm African American with shoulder length hair 4c and I never had a perm. I'm glad I purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price
Quiet and efficient.<br />Nice wall mount.
I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  It's very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.
I put these in Rv's because they fit in a tight spot and work well.  Glynnsrv.com
This hair dryer is quiet, powerful and hot. Looks good, easy to handle. Very happy.
Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter. Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful.
Great item.  Would recommend!!!
Item received in great condition.
Good price.very pleased
Have had this for almost 3 years now without any problems.. That's impressive for hai dryers and hair straighteners anymore
Simple blow dryer with cool function
Love this dryer! Well worth the money!!  So glad I finally bought it!! :)
Excellent hairdryer. My wife loves it!
Very good quality ! I love it!
Daughter loves it...
Lighter than my previous hair dryer.  And it dries faster with softer results.
Best I have ever purchased!!!
I was apprehensive about buying this because it was more expensive then what I usually buy, but it's well worth it. Dries my hair very fast without a lot of high heat. We got this mainly for my husband because he has dreads and this was recommended to dry the dreads out completely and now both of us use it.
Love it
Have had it for 4 years and still going strong!! :)
Great hair dryer!!!!!
Wife loves it.
I read some bad reviews on this hair dryer but so far I have not had any problems with it. I actually love it, cute colors and drys well
Great
So far, so good.  I have found that these hair dryers do not last, so, &#34;time will tell&#34;.<br />Works good, no complaints.
Works great
Good just loudd
Don't know the longevity of this item yet. But it's a must have for travel. On the Euro setting, low is high enough! I have lots of fine, curly medium length hair and it dried in less than 10 minutes. Yes, it's loud but worth it as a space saver and effective dryer!
Bought as gift.....it is just as advertised, does work well & durable for a year now!
Wonderful product!  Purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery.  I can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction.
Super light and easy to handle.  Dries fast and isn't too loud.  A+++++
Great, small, light and does exactly what I need. Who could ask for more?
Bought this as a present for my wife this Christmas. She has used it many times since and absolutely loves it. She says it has cut her dry time in half!
Easy installation, and the wife loves it, so in my book that's worth 5 stars.
Great hair dryer my wife loves it.  She says it's as good as her expensive high end model that it replaced and weighs less.
I got this to replace an ancient hairdryer that just wasn't working well anymore.  This is a wonderful hairdryer!  I can dry my hair quickly and it has all the possible settings that I'll ever need.  I am totally happy with this!
I have very thick, very curly hair that typically takes a LONG time to dry. The little mini-hair-driers that you find in most hotels these days just won't do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel-diffuser attachment (which us curly-girls require). But with this hair-drier, I found the answer!!! It has GREAT air-power, 2 heat settings, and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well. Barely adds any weight to your luggage (so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non-carry-on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit) and the handle folds up for compact packing. The diffuser attachment works quite well -- maybe not quite as effective as my full-size diffuser with my full-size drier, but pretty darned good. It's great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time. Highly recommended!
Wife says this is the best drier that she has owned to date. Loves it
Best little Travel Dryer ever.  Very Powerful, very compact. Lasts forever. Does not produce static. I'm on my 3rd one, not because the previous two were faulty, but because I lost one and the other finally wore out. I only wish they made them in more colors. Buy this and you won't regret it.
Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I've never used (pinpointer and curler?) The 'cool' button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn't have a 'medium' setting but I don't think that's worth 20 bucks. If you don't like the color blue, well you're outta luck. Guess since it isn't foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.
My wife has had this for almost 2 years and she likes it, still works just fine
Perfection! Just the right heat and no more overly dried out hair! Thank you!
Love this dryer. It's light and dries my<br />Hair super fast.
Love it. Heats up good. Fast delivery. Easy set up!
Works great ! it's strong and small enough for travelling
Love this dryer.I have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers.I am very picky and I highly recommend this dryer.
This was my second one to own. It lasted for years. I hope this one will be the same. I recommend this hair dryer. Thanks Amazon. ðŸ˜€
Super light. I have a problem on my wrist And usually have a hard time drying/styling my hair. This blow dryer made my hair work so much easier And painless. The power is great too! I would reccomend it to anyone!
This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!! I take it to gym, travel and daily hair routine.
Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful
Love it !
AWESOME dryer!
good
Rated this five stars because of<br />1) There are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot<br />2) There are 2 speeds<br />3) Not heavy & it has a long cord<br />4) The 2 combing and area specific drying pieces<br />5) The great product & low price.<br />This is product is great, and is worth more than the price I payed.
Great dryer.... Cut drying time in half! Looks like a professional job!
this is a great product! very efficient and easy to use.
Love this... It has made blow drying so much easier for me.
Wife loves it
Love this.  Light weight and dries my hair very fast.
Love it it's just what I wanted. I prefer this style of hand dryer to others and the attachments are great! No complaints.
the best hair dryer I've ever used!!!! I will highly recommend it to any one! I know this is expensive, but this is absolutely worth the money!!! You have to use it to believe what i said! my hair looks soo good now, my friends notice that and ask me what did i do differently. every body need to have one!!
This fit into my Conair 1875. It works great!
Thought I was the only weirdo that struggled to dry her hair w/in 45mins.<br /><br />Recently found out my best friend is the same & she (like me) was convinced there was no way around it.  Writing this review b/c there's probably more of us out there.  And you 100% aren't stuck.<br /><br />I've got long, thin hair - but a lot of it.  It traps moisture & it's naturally wavy, so it always took me 30-45mins to tame it dry.  Most of the time, a solid 45mins.  Result was hit or miss.  Since I have to wash my hair every other day, breaking point comes when you don't want to wash your hair b/c you don't want to deal with the drying time & tired arms (...and I'm strong).<br /><br />Bought this on a whim during a Gilt Group sale, when my generic (probably Conair) dryer was on the out.<br /><br />Now I dry my hair in 10-15mins.  Usually, a bankable 10mins.  On a bad hair day, 15mins.<br /><br />No, seriously.<br /><br />On top of that pile of awesome, it's very light & evenly weighted.  Buttons are intuitive & don't get accidently knocked on/off while you use it.  Results are always the same.  Doesn't damage my hair w. heat (probably b/c it takes so little time).  And it's small enough that it's an easy travel companion.<br /><br />Don't get scared off by this dryer's price - it's a life saver.  And game changer.  Delay getting this if you want to waste your time.<br /><br />For the Holy Trifecta: this hairdryer, a boar bristle roller brush, & Shu Uemura White Tea Polishing Milk.<br /><br />This dryer & a boar bristle brush easily tames my hair w. little effort & leaves it looking silky smooth.  Every time.  (Note: choose a brush that has both natural boar bristles & taller plastic bristles w. the knob-like, non-scratchy tip - needs a decent amount of boar bristles, but few enough to let air through easily. It doesn't have to be expensive, just needs to fit those parameters.)  For doubled ease, get Shu's White Tea Polishing Milk.  A little goes a long way.  You'll be a happyaddict.  Rub some in your hands & pat it from middle of your hair to the ends, but particularly the ends to give them a little tangle protection.  It helps smooth my hair even faster & it lets my hair better tackle humidity - friends have commented that I look normal when they feel they don't.  PS - The brush & Shu isn't a hack - the dryer is.  The 3 together is trifecta.<br /><br />I was ecstatic to find this - I'd always struggled just to tame my stubborn hair.  Now I actually feel in control of it.  Just bought a replacement for my 3/4yr old original & also bought one for my mom as an xmas present. My friend's now a convert & begging for the name of my dryer.<br /><br />You won't regret.
Don't need a towel anymore in college.
Time has proven this is a good product.  Would buy another one.
BEST COMPACT HAIRDRYER I'VE EVER OWNED.
Works great to dry my daughters natural hair.
Works well and the speed and temperature  adjustments are easy to use.  Well worth the small amount it costs.
I love this product, it has a good performance, I really fall in love, is simple to use and practice to mobilize
Sure does blow hot.
excellent product
I love this. My mom got it for me for Christmas and it's definitely one of the best Christmas gifts I've ever gotten. Peopel complained that it didn't have a medium setting but I personally didn't see a need for it. I use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great. It doesn't burn my neck or ears. I would definitely reccomed
Quickly dries your hair without frying it~!!!
It's great!!!
Great dryer!  Have had it for quite some time and have not had any issues
Powerful little guy!!  Does the job, neat, compact. Love it!  JJ
muy bueno
Works great, cord retracts as expected.
I've been using this for the past 3, almost 4 years and it still works the same way as when I first took it out of the box.
My wife loves it;
Perfect size, dries my hair fast.  I like the built-in nightlight.
I love it very much.I recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hair dryer.  Roseli
I love my wall mounted blow dryer! It puts out a great volume of air which I like and was looking for. It doesn't get too hot.... temp is just right. I like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night. I would purchase this item again in a heart beat !
I gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She said that she loves it!
Very nice dryer.  It's not as powerful as ones I've had in the past but I have short hair. I don't think it would be powerful enough for long hair. It was my mistake not to realize the power level that was posted in the ad.
My mother loves this lightweight hair dryer.  Says its easy to use.
I love this hair dryer.
Installed this unit in my RV.  Works great for it's size. Gets very hot on HI.
Love it!
This is the third house we have put these into our master baths.  I even have one installed in our RV!  So handy and so much neater in appearance.
Perfect size. Does just what I want!!! No complaints!
Dried my wife's thick hair in 10 minutes.
Works great and half the cost of the store. Plus free Shipping.
best ever! has lasted a long time!
the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries- its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast, but i haven't had any issues like that with this dryer yet.
Works great!  My 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it and it's easier for them than using a regular hair dryer.
Just what I was looking for....works great!
Love it I use it on all my clients and gets very hot
Very good and efficient quiet too.
had it about 5 months.  very happy with it.  light enought for 3/4th graders to use on longer hair
I'm not sure if I had low expectations going in or what but very pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too loud, fits my head properly and will dry your hair ( obviously you're probably going to sit under there for awhile.. Took me about 2hr30mins ). Money well spent ( especially considering the $$$ spent at the salon).
This hairdryer is great. It is so much better than the cheap 25 dollars hair dryers I used to get from the store. No frizz (and I live in Florida where we have tons of humidity) and it dries my hair in half the time. The cord is not retractable, but that is my only quirk with the dryer. If you are looking to step up and not pay 100 dollars for a hairdryer this one is awesome. I'm truly impressed.
We love this blow dryer because it does the job under 10 minutes that is a lifesaver for the people in my home. This blow dryer was exceptional value.
Excelent!
I honestly do not know where this has been my entire life.  I have very thick and wavy hair, this dryer styles my hair in half the time.  I usually would blow dry my hair, put a frizz control then use the flat iron.  With this my hair is healthier, I don't have to use my flat iron as much and I use very little anti-frizz product now. I would reccomend this to anyone who has thick, wavy, or even curly hair and wants to be able to quickly style their hair. I've tried everything thing I could think of to get my hair to straighten easily and efficently and this is the one.  In 32 years, I've never been more in love with any of my hair tools.
Best investment needed a good blow dryer
lots of power...works great
It works great. Love it!
Lots of power for a little dryer!
While the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year, this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far.
Just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran, yes--ran, to write this review.  I cannot believe this is my hair!  I have shoulder-length, course, thick, curly hair which I blow dry and iron.  I have always used high-end hair dryers, but this is the best ever.  Worth twice the price!  Not only did my hair dry faster, but it dried frizz-free.  I did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry.  First time ever not having to flat iron.  My hair looks like it does when I come from the hair dresser.  I can't believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference, but I can assure you, it does.  Thank you Sedu.  I am a believer.
Good size
My daughter loved it for Christmas
I love this blow dryer, its small and powerful, exactly what I wanted
Came in quick.. Amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat!
This hair dryer is amazing, it cuts my hair drying time to half, with smooth shining hair as result. Shipping was from Japan, took about 10 days to arrive in US with registered mail.
Best hair dryer ever.  Need I say more?
I love it, it's not too heavy, not loud, the cored about 4ft, gives good heat, and leaves my hair soft and silky.
Excellent product. ... this a replacement for another turbo that I bought 15 years ago , and I used almost every day of the week... I won't buy any other hair dryer. ...
The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  I had an old one that I loved but I used it so much, I had to get a new one.  One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry.
It dries my hair very quickly and is very light weight.  Great hair dryer!
nice hair dryer
This is my second--I blew up the first forgetting to convert from US to European currency (it was quite dramatic).  But I rushed to Amazon on my return and bought another one--it really is the best US or intercontinental hair dryer I've ever traveled with.  It gets very hot on high--which is just fine with me.  And it's a noisy sucker.<br /><br />But it weighs very little and is a real trooper--I think I had the first one over five years (and its ultimate failure was mine not the manufacturer's).<br /><br />Read the reviews--most people really really like it.
Super great hair dryer for very little cost.  I own a $200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better.
There is nothing more to say about dryer, except that you get what you pay for. It is quiet and fast, like a ninja. Maybe they should rename it, lol. I bought this for my daughter, but when she's not around, I find myself &#34;borrowing&#34; it. Hey, I paid for it, don't judge me :)
Works great for price.
Great product
I can't believe how this hair dryer made my hair feel so soft and not frizzy.
Great product
Bought for my wife. Seems to work as advertised. Wife is happy.
I love this hairdryer!  I've had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny!  My hair is very thick and frizzy/curly (slightly past my shoulders).  I used to have my hair professionally done (roller-set and blown out) every week when I lived close to my favorite hair salon.  When my husband and I moved, I couldn't find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments, and it was just getting expensive.  I've had other standing hair bonnet dryers, but this is the kind I see most at professional hair salons, and for a reason.  It's fairly quiet (except for the ticking sound from the timer).  It goes up to 75 degrees Celsius, which is about 167 degrees Fahrenheit (very hot), but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps.  I usually keep mine at 65 degrees Celsius (about 150 F).  There is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour, which is what I need.  I don't have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set.  I just roller-set my hair, set the timer, and read or nap until the dryer stops.  I love it!  Caveat: While assembly is easy, it was not so smooth to do.  My husband had to re-order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time.  Still worth it, if you have the space to store it!
Works great!  I love that it's big since I have tons of hair.
I love it!!!
Product arrived quickly and worked as expected in Europe.
Like it.
I good investment.
Works great!
I purchased this to go with my Rusk W8less Professional Hair Dryer and it fits perfectly! I love that the bowl is large and really deep. This is a must-have for curly hair!
BUENO
So far this hair dryer is amazing.  I love the various settings which allows for less frizz.  It is heavier than my last hair dryer I owned (different brand) but I think it is because it is better constructed.  Drying time does seem a bit faster but hard to tell as my hair is thick.
I hate most blow dryers.  They're either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair.  This one is perfect.  I have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day.  Either I'm loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer.  Dries fast, too. Highly recommend.
great
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘
Very good product, excellent 100% recommended.
Very powerful dryer, worth every penny.
this was a gift to my daughter.  She loves it!
Love this hair dryer. Delivery was on time as stated. Will order again when needed.
I really like this hair dryer because I have naturally curly hair and the diffuser works great. The hair dryer temp settings plus I know if it last as long as my last Conair hair dryer 9 years I will be happy. This is the third Conair hair dryer I have bought
Ver y good I recomendet
Better than expected.  Great product, excellent delivery.
just as expected
Very good dryer for the price.
Its is just what i wanted. Love it.
Great
Very happy with the hair dryer, its everything I hoped for
Lasts for years. This is my second one and when this one dies, I'll replace it with the same one. Cord keeper is awesome- I'll never go back. Excellent quality blow dryer- hot and dries fast.
Great
great deal! great product for the money!
Got this for my daughter for Christmas. it has great power and dries fast!
really good in use
Wonderful and so very light
dries fantastically and leaves my hair shiny
Great medium sized dryer. Wont kick the breakers.
I have had 4 of these and love them. This last one started burning up in my hand!!! I got my new one in three days, in time for another shampoo. I love Amazon!!
Use it daily, works great and I can bring it anywhere with me!
Perfect for travel
She liked this product a lot
love
This dryer is excellent for being so small! Terrific air flow & heat settings, not heavy, great quality, and looks high end. It's a bit noisy, but that doesn't matter much. Loving it!!
A top tier home hair dryer.  It has all the features:  More heat, at 1875 watts  ---  Salon quality motor - up to 40% more air flow and three times the service life  ---  Ceramic pearl technology (Ceramics for even heating, and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair)  ---  Ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions  ---  Concentrator and diffuser blower attachments  ---  Three heat settings, two fan speeds, and a cool shot feature.<br /><br />I don't use hair dryers.  My wife does, and when she broke her old Remington T/Studio, she would have nothing but another T/Studio as a replacement.  By the way, this dryer has a 4 year warranty, so keep your receipt.  (In our case, the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt, and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke . . . so I appropriated the old dryer, wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when I need one).<br /><br />Not cheap, but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us.  By the way, the Amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement.
Very nice looking blow dryer and performs great too! It is a replacement for another Conair that I bought about 10 years ago.....I highly recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive Ionic Blow dryer!
Perfect!
I bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3M Indoor Window Insulator Kit, and it worked perfectly for that purpose, especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment. It did not get super hot (which was good for the window kit), though I have no idea if that's good or bad from a hair drying perspective. I could have bought a cheaper hair dryer, but I chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic, ionic, has several attachments, and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting -- all with the idea that after I was done using it on the window kit, I could provide it to female guests. This turned out to be a good idea, since my housemate's younger sister is currently visiting, and she was happy that I had a hair dryer for her to use. I asked for her opinion, and she says, &#34;It's great.&#34; Pressed for more details, she says, &#34;I like that it has a lot of different settings.&#34; As it turns out, this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used. So I might also recommend reading some of the other reviews... :)
Love it!!
BUY THIS PEOPLE. VERY STRONG!
Can I just say that this is my SECOND hair dryer by Remington? I loved my first one so much that I wore it out! (A one to many drops on the floor after a few years)
Nice work
Love the product!
Love the power of this!
best ever.  we have owned 2.
Working out well.
It rewinds every time!  Has the usual features, is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature, it blends well in the bathroom.
It works well for me.
Super!
Great price, standard shipping, nice product
This was bought for my daughter. Mine is about 7 years old, and this one is just as good as mine.
awesome!!
works great! im pretty picky about everything, but I'd buy this again and again!
Wife and daughter love it.  They fight over it. Ha
Does everything a hair dryer should do. Sturdy, nice design, powerful, and totally blows. In a good way.
Works well
New favorite dryer for professional use. I am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference. This things blows hard and gets hot. I use it on medium heat and low speed and still cut my drying time in half with gorgeous results. Very little need for curling iron or flat irons when done. Time saver, light weight and I even like the diffuser:
Graduation gift for my niece.  She loved it.  Especially the fact that the cord disappears into it.....
My son loves it, dries quickly and is very strong!
This is a great unit to organize the bathroom. I'm not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and I'm not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time. This is a great compromise. The unit is always ready to use and it doesn't take up space. Also, I am not able to mount this in studs, so I was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall. There's no problem with that. I even bought an extra one for my kids' bathroom--and you know how kids can be rough. Both units are fine and show no sign of loosening. Lastly, it's easy to install. Love that part. I highly recommend this product.
These are nice hair dryers.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband - they're great.  Every time a guest has used mine they comment on how nice it is.  Feels like your at the salon.
Love the lightweight design. Works great
Working perfect!
Awesome.
Works well, no problems.
I love this dryer! I like that it has multiple heat and speed settings. It's very light.
Exactly as described and quick delivery.
Great! Everything I expected from Conair. MORE than enough heat for my thick curly hair. Love it!
Love it!!
Dryes hair superfast!
Loved the products and very pleased with the quick delivery.
We have purchased three of these and they do not last. This last purchased lasted 7 months. Will not purchase this item again.
love it.
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I have heard no complaints so far. Shipping was fast.
Great for traveling overseas. It folds great into luggage. Just remember to switch it to currency when overseas.
Excellent buy! Dries hair quickly and quietly!
my wife loves it!
Love this little hair dryer! It's small, but definitely powerful enough.
Works great, low price, arrived promptly.  The speed settings were just right, in terms of low speed getting air through my hair without blowing it around too much and high speed giving a good blast.  The high-low temp worked well also.
awesome look, good hairdryer
The most light hairdryer I ever had. Good quality.
Bought it for my wife because her cheap hairdryer was extremely loud and woke me up.  This one is awesome.  Super quiet and she loves it.  It is quiet enough that we can actually talk while she drys her hair.  That would never have happened with the old dryer.  She says it takes about 5 minutes longer to dry her hair, but that is because she only uses it on medium heat.  High heat is very hot and she is afraid it will hurt her hair.
Excellent dryer, light weight and drys hair quickly. Speed and heat can be varied to suit whoever is using it.<br />The only con is the plug does not fit snuggly in the wall outlet, it's a but lose, but that said it stays in! I would definitely buy it again.
Perfect travel hair dryer for overseas!
Good dryer!!
Works 100 times better than the old hair dryer. I'd definitely suggest it.
Wow.  This thing is great!<br /><br />No, it's not as powerful or capable as a &#34;full-sized&#34; dryer.  But, what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand?  I, myself, expect a lot less than this dryer delivers.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of travel hair dryers, this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it.  This lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every-which-way mess of air that most travel dryers produce.  It's not as directional as a full-sized dryer with a longer barrel, but it's better than most travel dryers.<br /><br />One reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled.  This is not true on the dryer I received.  The Low/Off/High switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked.<br /><br />Several reviewers have complained of it making a very high-pitched motor noise, getting very hot, smelling bad, and then dying.  The unit is shipped set for 125V (USA) power.  While it is true that many modern electronic devices have &#34;auto-ranging&#34; or &#34;universal&#34; AC inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere, this little hairdryer isn't one of them.  If you plug this dryer into 250V (European) power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250V setting, the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described.  And that will be your fault, misuse, and not cause for a poor review.<br /><br />Mine has worked fine.  It drys my hair almost as fast as my &#34;professional&#34; dryer at home.  Its size, weight, and performance make this an easy choice for travel.
the best compact hair dryer I ever own, great for vacation travel.
I've always been skeptical about new, amazing, breakthrough technology in beauty products.  I certainly believe there are different levels of quality and also that one product may perform better or worse on different people.  So I was hoping this dryer would make a difference, while being prepared for less than spectactular results.  So drum roll please...I personally thought my hair looked silkier, shinier and it did dry noticeably faster, but the shocker was that other people really noticed the difference!<br />My adult daughters to whom I am often apparently invisible, both asked me individually and on seperate occassions if I had just had my hair done, and what had I done differently etc.  Ironically, the evening that I had in fact come straight from the salon (and prior to using this product) warranted no notice.  I've had others compliment my hair as well.  I'm giving more weight to those who see me all the time and tend not to use flattery to judge that there was a very noticable difference.<br />  The other thing worth mentioning is that in my youth my hair was one of my best assests in terms of appearance.  For the past 10 years or so, its become a definite liability.  I joke that it's a fire hazard and I'm not allowed near open flame as it is so dry and so covered in product that its quite flammable.  I put a fair bit of effort into getting it to be healthier and less frizzy and I've actually had people ask me if I've ever tried a really good conditioner or anti-frizz product.  After what I hope is a chilling gaze I let them know I do believe I have tried nearly all conditioners/styling products. So it is a rare thing indeed for me to rave about a hair product or in this case hair dryer and I must give it a rave review!<br />  If you possess beautiful, soft, smooth heathly hair this may not be worth the money,  but if like me you color frequently and have those weird coarse alien hairs springing up randomly then I would say go for it!
I love this hairdryer.  I really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer.  My old dryer was much louder.
nice
I luv this product.. it's not only attractive but it does what it said. Makes my hair soft & shinny.
I wanted one that blows hard and I could control the temperature too..this one works and the price was fair.
lots of power in this little dryer
Best dryer ever.<br />I am able to dry my medium length, thin hair in 5 minutes. Not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style. I'm on my 2nd one of these in 3 yearsâ€?I travel with this dryer so it gets beat up, but has outlasted every other dryer I've ever had.
i got this for my mom and she loved it
Discovered this little gem in a hotel in NYC. Dries hair without leaving frizz or fly-aways. Folding handle makes it convenient for storing and travel.
GREAT hair dryer!!!
Best one I ever had!
It dries my hair fast and I have thick hair. It's light weight. A great price! My hair feels amazing after.
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
perfect for me, i love it
Works great, also love the heat settings and the rubberized finish.
its a great hair dryer.
Use it as a cheap heat gun for installing skins and such on tablets and phones.  Works well enough.
excellent
Plenty of both air and heat.
Petit, cute, powerful! Better than the one I use usually at home
Works better than the large one I have and is so small
I was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that I have had for years. This one was similar in size and has a few more features.  The cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage. The handle is more comfortable than my old one also. Would definitely buy again.
Excellent hair dryer. Love It
perfect goodsâ€¦recommend it.
This is a great little hairdryer!  Nice for traveling, but I use mine everyday.  It dries my hair very fast, and its so lightweight.
It's nice but kind a heavy when u need to blow dry you hair your hand will hurt
I love this dryer. It dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. It leaves my hair soft  and shiny.
This is an amazing professional hair dryer!!! I brought this dryer for my sister as a Christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed!!!
Excellent
I am a former hair dresser of the 60's and 70's .All hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer.So I feel qualified to rate this dryer. IT ROCKS! The heat and air circulation are great. Temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use. The hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer. Best of all,its quiet. Instructions for assembly are very vague. Just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you'll figure it out. I had mine together and running in about 15 minutes. For the money I don't think you could go wrong. The only thing I would change is the plastic legs. But what isn't plastic these days? Good buy.
Great Hair Dryer
I love how quiet this blow dryer is. It has a comfortable grip on it and does a beautiful job of drying my hair without any frizz.
I'm really satisfied with this purchase, and I totally recommend it
I liked it, it was a present to my Son-in -Law.  He was happy to receive it, but I don't have any feedback yet.  They are out of state for visit.
As advertised!
Amazing hair dryer! My mom bought me this dryer when I was 12 im 24 now it still works I bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing, trust me when I say this is the best investment you could possibly make!!!
Very nice
Very well made, and works great. I have really thick hair and it gets the job done in about 5 min.
This is the second one I've purchased.  The first just wore out.  Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  Works great.
My favoret
My favorite. Easy handling.
Great product!
First bumped into this product while travelling. Marriott Hotels do a good job of equiping their Hotel Rooms with User-Friendly<br />Appliances. This dryer is no exception. Its' small, compact, hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror. My wife raves about.<br />Dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer. I have had this dryer for several years, cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong. There are several styles, check the model that best fits your<br />needs.
My favorite hair dryer ever!! Why anyone wants one where the cord is all over I don't know.  Works great and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!
excellent
Nice product. Delivery on time. Works well. Looks good.
Nice unit
excellent
I am very happy so far with this dryer.  The controls are easy to manipulate, even while drying and styling.  The slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers.  And the company, XTAVA, has reached out to me, expressing their desire that I am happy with their product and to please let them know if I have questions.  I find this very refreshing and impressive.
Love it
Love this dryer. Went on vacation and did not take it. Missed it a lot!!!
Easy to install and handy.
I did a LOT of research for a trip to England/Scotland I was using this for. I had no problems at all with this, it was light and compact, perfect to cram into an already full suitcase. PLEASE NOTE- this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage (they use other voltage there) BUT you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs!! This only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the States won't fry your head or die on you, a wall converter is very cheap (about $8 and can be bought almost anywhere). I used the wall converter for multiple appliances (phone charger, etc.) but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well.
This hair dryer is great..Leaves my hair so shiny after it is dried. Just the right size.
Very good construction!
Good Product. Like hot and normal button features.
Amazing product, the cool air feature keeps my wife from burning her neck. Best hair dryer she has ever had!!
product of very good quality, 100% satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items.
used it for travel abroad - served me perfectly
dries hair in minutes!! confinent!!
Great product.  Works better than expected.
BEST BLOW DRYER EVER,<br />NO MORE FRIZZIES<br />ITS A MUST HAVE
I love this blow dryer. The price was great I have short hair it blows it dry in no time.
I have been enjoying this blow dryer.
My daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer.  It is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one.
Great product and quick ship.  Thank you.
Good product.
I love the attachables combs and brush as a Afro American it really straighten your hair
This baby has power!  I have very thick hair......and a lot of it........this cut my blow drying time down significantly!!  It is a little loud but is totally worth it.  The only problem I had was it set off my smoke detector when I was using a round brush with it.
This is a newer model of the one that we already had that finally stopped working. We loved the older model and are glad that we were able to replace it with this one. It is just what we wanted.
This is lightweight and quiet and seems to keep my hair smoother.
Much stronger then I expected great for my tween daughter starting to want to do the grown up girl stuff or for me to borrow for a trip
No issues with this hair dryer and its been months. I love it
Works better than any I have used in the past.  Recommended by my beautician.
very nice and functional hair dryer.  Easy to mount and easy to use; powerful without harming hair.
Love how compact this item is.  Nice not to have to dig around under cabinet to find a hairdryer.  It works so well for being such a small dryer.  Highly recommend this item
Great!
Wifey had one for 8 years, w/o big issues; until it died.<br />She loves it, and as a professional stylist she knows a thing ot two about the topic.<br />I bought her another one for Christmas, so hopefully manufacture haven't change specs dated as previous one.
Good dryer for curly hair
This is an awesome blowdryer - it has cut my &#34;getting ready&#34; time by at least a third! Definitely recommend
Powerful, efficient and convenient. Can't ask for more. My wife loves it.
Great little hair dryer! I needed something that was easy to pack for traveling AND had a diffuser. I love this little dryer.
Best blow dryer ever. I spend lots of money on my blow dryers.  One because I have a lot of thick curly hair and I like to straighten it. This works super fast and I am very pleased.
Very convenient mounted on our bathroom wall next to the mirror over the sink.
Great hair dryer. Durable and easy to use. Cord will not retract all the way after but I have found that in every retractable that I have ever purchased.
best size for soar arms!
hot
Blow drys the hair Smooth and silky
Great little dryer. It completes the drying process quickly and doesn't make a lot of noise.  It is light weight and easy to handle.
My wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom. It dried her hair so she is happy, which means I am happy.
This blowdryer is really powerful. I love it. I get my hair dried in half the time. I used to have a portable blowdryer that had half the power. What a difference a good blowdryer makes to a readying process! This thing is saving me time.
comes with a case and ultra compact.
Got the Elchim a few weeks ago and love it so far! Blows my curly hair out quickly and nice and smoothly. I highly recommend it!
Nice blowdryer for the price!
I like how the cord goes inside.and the dryer works great. Agreat dryer that I would buy again. This did arrive on time.<br />Thank you.
I have wanted this for Christmas two years in a row and finally someone in my family purchased it, NOW they want one!
I cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is. I searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe. I have fine hair, not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand. This one works great for my fine hair, and a plus is that I have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers. There are two settings for ionic, and I don't know what the other setting is supposed to do, but the other setting does introduce static, so I use one ionic setting at all times. The main characteristic I searched for was the sound volume and pitch. Someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer, and that convinced me to purchase this model. It is actually true - the pitch is not really a pitch, but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums. My husband can actually sleep when I blow dry, where he could not before. As for lasting ability, it is a quality hairdryer, and I have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul.
Super nice hair dryer:)
Use it every day.
Purchased to replace same dryer we have had in out bathroom for the last 10 years. That should say everything.  The old one lasted 10 years and the fact I purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy I am with it.
Works great! As advertised and great price, doubt there's a cheaper better one out there!
Great Prod
If you have hair that takes FOREVER to dry, this is the hair dryer for you.  It not only dries your hair, but leaves it soft and shiny. I have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one.  I discovered the Remington Jet Dry Turbo about 10 or 15 years ago (it used to come in bluish/purple). During this time, I've often looked for other models just to see if I could find something better, and there just isn't anything.  Many times, you'll find me using two hair dryers at the same time (which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload). I used stylist models that cost around $150 (Bespoke, Rusk Speed Freak, etc.) to Consumer Reports Best Hair Dryer - which I think the people who are reviewing them don't have lots of hair... because nothing holds a candle to this model.<br /><br />They also have a compact one that I keep in my gym bag.  It's not as good, but will do in a pinch.
Excellent!
My expectations were met
I was tired of dealing with a large blow dryer on a daily basis, and wanted one that was small enough to fold and pack for a trip.  This blow dryer is powerful and dries my hair in less than five minutes.  Highly recommended!
So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power! Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings. Love the zebra carrying bag too. Very happy with this purchase!!!
Great hair dryer. Been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far.
This is a great little hair dryer.
Great purchase. I have thick hair. Hair dried well and felt silky too.
Daughter loves it.  Works just as reviews stated.  Well worth the money.
I'm only giving these a 3/5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival.  I thought it was strange that it didn't get hot even on the highest heat setting...... it was still cool enough after several seconds that I could aim it directly at my face comfortably.  On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!    UPDATE: I received my replacement (what a simple process, too... kudos for easy returns!), and this hairdryer is perfect for me.  Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).  Very happy!  Love the feel and heft of it, too.
This has the power I like to use to get my hair dry fast. It's also got the low settings for really setting a curl or straightening hair. This has some force to the blow dry.
exelente
I love this out of the way blow dryer!  For the price you can't beat it!  It actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom.
The best blow dryer I've ever used.  Ever.  I could go on and on about all the great features, how powerful it is, and even how great it looks but the best feature, for me, is the non-slip exterior.  I can't tell you how many times my old blow dryers went crashing to the floor due to their slippery casings, but the texturized exterior on this dryer allows me to get a good grip r - and keep that grip - throughout the entire drying process.  The best!
So far so good.  She's happy with the dryer.
First used one of these in a hotel, and loved it.. the retractable cord gets stuck , but still love it
I love it.
Love it! Works great and is do quiet!
My husband put it together and got to use it twice. So far so good, but you do need to be careful so it won' tip over. It is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad. If I did not hear the ticking I would not know if it was on or not. I can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that's how quiet it is and it gets really hot. My husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable. For the amount of money I think it is worth it.
Awesome hair dryer.  Definitely professional quality.  It takes less time to dry my hair now.  Also, I love how long the cord is.
a
Love
Great hair dryer for the price.  I battle frizz a lot, and this dryer does a great job controlling frizz while drying my hair.
Wife loves it.
There is no way you get a better blow. This one does a flawless job! Very hot!
I love it. Always liked them when we stayed in hotels. Now I have my own.
Received it today...the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.
Loves it and it can blow cool air too. Very easy to use. Thanks again
GREAT HAIR DRYER
Works well.
I already had one of these as my grown children recommended this great hair dryer.  I just bought two more to have in our condo for vacation rentals.  It is so nice to stay in a place that has a decent hair dryer.  This is the one!
excelent
Awesome use everyday!!!
Terrific, inexpensive hair dryer.  As good as dryers costing 2, 3, 4 even 5 times this one.  Gets hot quickly, stays hot, works well, light weight, easy to maneuver.  better for travel than most dryers designed specifically for travel.  We love it!
The dryer is really good but came with a missing part (diffuser) but as it is not really needed, am not bothered by it. Arrived early and well packaged. Would recommend it. Very easy to use.
Love this hairdryer!  Lightweight, good strong air flow, and a long cord!
We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  Small but plenty powerful.
I LOVE this diffuser.
Never thought the blow dryer made a big difference....always thought it was the styling products...guess again,this will be the only blow dryer i will ever use or buy again.... awesome for curly hair.
My wife just loves it heat, power and abilities.  She saw it on board a cruise ship and simply loved it and purchased it right after we got back home.
great hair dryer,  love the controls on this.
Exactly what I wanted at a very good price
works
I am so glad I got this little hair dryer. I have thick, wavy hair and I need a powerful hair dryer to dry it. This is very powerful, more so than my at home hair dryer. I love the retractable cord. Easy for traveling. I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1/4 pounds. I thought it would weigh more. A good purchase.
This hair dryer works extremely well and is easy to handle.  The price is very reasobable.
I have been using this Remington hair dryer for several years now. I think the one I am currently using is my 3rd, and this recent purchase is my backup for when the current one runs its course.  I am particular in wanting a hair dryer with oomph. I like hairdryers with big bursts of hair - basically that are loud and fast.  I grow impatient with many other models.  This one fits the bill just right.  I also like the look and feel.
For the international traveler, this is a must.  Works there and at home as well.
Love it
Small but powerful.  Easy install and arrived on time.
Excellent purchase. If your hairs are wet and messy, the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage.
I love the heat - It's more warm than hot like most blow dryers. I feel like it's better for my hair. Very light compared to my former blow dryer.
Great
Best hair dryer I've ever owned and anyone who has come over and used it has remarked on how great the air stream is and how fast it dries.
I bought this for my 90 year old mother, she says its a great hair dryer, loves that it has 3 settings (low, med. high), and that the handle folds, and has retractable cord, also not loud.
It's doing wonders to my girlfriend's hair. She loves it
Pleased with everything!
Great hairdryer .the only thing is doesn't have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator.
great!
I bought this for using at home on family and friends and it works just great! Great dryer for the cheap price!
This hair dryer has a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly when I use the concentrator. Very quiet compared to my older blow dryer also.
great
Good blow dryer
My 12 year old loves this. It is perfect for her
It's great.
I love it. It was exactly what I wanted.
Very convenient hair dryer
Gentle on my hair. Quicker to dry my extraordinarily thick hair!  Compact and convenient.  I have 3 grown daughters who upon visiting have asked where I got it.  Guess what? Three more happy customers!  All three have varied thickness of hair too.  One is extremely think, one average thickness, one very thick and mine as stated extraordinarily thick. Love this hairdryer!
LOVE IT. Works well. I don't think I'd have paid the original price. Glad I got a deep discount. I does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother.
Love this hairdryer!  I'd buy it again - great value - it's heavy and seems like a more expensive hairdryer, works great!
Awesome dryer, made my fine hair dry in half the time, also gave it more volume.  Great purchase.
Great product
great
Great
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas..... she absolutely loves it!!!  An excellent dryer for alot less money than other top dollar dryers.  Dries fast, and much quieter than other dryers.
The BEST!!!!!
Purchased this years ago and I am still using it till this day!
Works great, really handy and portable.  Arrived quickly.  Great product!
Works great! I use it every day for a year and have had no problems with it. It looks nice too! There are sparkles in the black section of the blow dryer which is always fun :) There is also a vent in the back that opens to clean out the dust or hair that gets sucked in. For the money it's definitely worth it.
What more can you say about a hairdryer? It's hot when you set it on 'High', and cools quickly when you hold the blue button. It always turns on when you need it to. That's about all I need for a hair dryer, and this does it.
It's hot but not burn your hair hot, and powerful.  It's definitely worth buying
My first Yellow Bird lasted over 7 years and plenty of use by myself and friends. The best dryer ever. This new one works just as well, though I don't think I'll loan this one out so it might last longer.
So far, a very nice dryer for the price.
Love it!
great product exactly what I expected
excellent dryer, good quality
Good but can not use in some Asian countries due to the voltage difference.
Just perfect!!
Love this purchase. The heat is just right, not too hot. It sits easily in the holder. It has two speeds which is nice. It great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer,  it's convenient to have it right on the wall.
Muy Bien
It is the best. The strength of the wind is amezing. It is light weight. It came at the right time and I would recommend to everyone who wants to buy it.
love itï¼?12/13/2014
I love this hair dryer with all of the setting it is great for my hair.so if you are looking for a good hair dryer this would be it.
Love it. Powerful and totally worth the price. Dries my hair in half the time.
For just $7.99 & FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don't need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more?
Works great! I recommend it!
THE BOMB!!!!!!!!! I have thick hair and at 41 yrs old been looking, for years, for a blow dryer that BLOWS ALOT OF AIR. BINGO, Found it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!!!
Good product and delivery was performed as expected
This is a great portable hair dryer.  My hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers, but this one is really a good product.  I love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology, which I really need for my hair.  I can keep the frizzies out, and my hair dries quickly without drying out.  Blow drying is so much easier.  I am really picky about blow dryers and my hair, so I am not being frivolous here.  This dryer is a keeper! So convenient for travel!
This is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted. Much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits.
Awesome dryer! It's fast and efficient with less noise than my old Conair dryer! Fast shipping was a plus!
This is an excellent hair dryer and really feels like it will last a long time.  Very high quality and well worth the money.  Only gripe is the toggle switches are a tiny bit too short/small for me to hit with one handed operation but thats just me. This is a must buy if you are in the market for a decent hair dryer that isn't too expensive. MM
Can not enough about. Thought it was all BS about the ionic, tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect. OMG it is so true. I only tried this blow dryer because I wasn't gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false. Even me going cheap worked. Do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands. This will get the job done. You should never use above 1800W anyhow. Don't forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well. MIRACLE worker.<br /><br />My hair usually takes 40 minutes plus With no brushing, which makes it take way longer.<br />My previous dryer had way more W and blew harder.<br />This dryer takes my hair 10-15 minutes (maybe) with brushing it out.<br />My hair is soft and semi sleek.<br /><br />My hair is extra coarse, dry, frizzy and THICK. This dryer made my hair wonderful. I was able to do things to my hair that I never have before because of it. So in love.
great price!
Highly recommend!!!I can even repair your hair!!!
Performs as expected. Easy to handle.
Light weight, relatively quiet, good heat control.  This is the best hairdryer I've owned in a long time.
This blow dryer is great. I had a Remington I bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago. I wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying. This thing is even better than the last Remington I had. Blows faster, dries quicker, uses less electricity, and is WAY lighter and smaller. Very impressed.
I am very satisfied with the product, arrived in very good time, very well protected .. and in terms of quality, I think is very good ... thank you very much and I hope that more people buy it ... it really is very good.
I bought this for my wife as a replacement for an older Conair.  She loves the speed and heat choices.  Very light and easy to use.  Also very easy to clean by removing the intake cover for the motor.  Some attachments included is a plus.
Love it!!!
no comment
Used this on a 3 week vacation to Europe. It worked great. no issues.
love the retractable cord. haven't had a problem with it yet.
I'm a hairstylist and this is my go to hair dryer in the salon and at home! It's the best!! Well worth the money! My last one lasted over 5 years (and I work 6 days a week)
Love it!
My daughter is a Cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early Christmas gift and business investment of course.
This is a GREAT dryer.  I have very long hair, and it used to take about 20 minutes to get it dry.  This dryer gets me out of the bathroom in about half that time.
Bought as a Christmas present....
Love it! Cuts my drying time in half.
It is a little loud, but overall it works great.
Bought this for my mom, she loves it!! and arrived very promptly and packaged very well.
good product
Excellent product and great seller
I had to replace my old Conair that finally quit on me.  I like that this one has a folding handle and a retractable cord for easy packing if you are traveling.  I have always trusted Conair's products and this one is great.
So convenient on the wall!!! This is my second one, I love it!
Best hair dryer I have found in a while. It is light weight, dries my thick, curly hair quickly, and it does a good job of not causing frizz.
Light and easy to use. Very good product
Bought as a travel dryer, but it's so light and powerful that I use it at home every day :)
Dries quickly without &#34;drying out&#34; my hair. Easy to handle and not heavy.
Small, powerful and effective. Strong air flow. Sure, the bearings get a little noisy but doesn't affect the performance.
WORKS GREAT!!!
I've always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic. I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying. It's really great and awesome engineering.
The hair dryer is just what I wanted!!!  Could not believe the improvements made to hair dryers since I purchased the last one 15 or so years ago.
The Oster Dryer came early and was exactly what I had ordered.  I can not live without a wall mounted dryer, because they are so convenient and handy to use.  I have had several of the dryers, but I wish they would last longer than one year.  Perhaps I use mine more than normal.
Exactly what I was looking for!  It folds in half for maximum storage!  Easy to use and I am able to dry my long hair within minutes!
Loved this compact hair dryer.  I keep it in my gym bag.  Nice quality and air blows great, like options.  Best deal for the price.
I love this blow dryer and it arrived quickly, the item was exactly what I order. I am pleased with this!
This is great blow dryer.  Heat and speed setting are wonderful.  I have past shoulder length hair, set it on half heat, dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy!
This dry works very well for drying ladies hair.  It is small but powerful.  Highly recommend for travel use.
Best blow dryer on the market from what I can tell.  The first one of these died on me after 5 years of daily use.  I did not hesitate to buy another one.  My thick hair is lustrous and bouncy.
Love this blow dryer works great!!!!!!
Great packaging and quick shipping. I love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low, even for a toddler. The high speed will do when she gets older, I'm sure.
Best hair dryer ever.
Love it
great product
A great hairdryer.
Can't beat the $10 price! I was looking for a new hair dryer, and this was one of the 3 choices I had. The other one was also Remington ($30), and the third was from another brand for around $60. I'm not a fan of yellow color, so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer (when I was looking at it, it cost around $20). However, next day the price went to $10, and I didn't have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what I was looking for. After trying the hair dryer, I can only say the best things - it works perfectly!
convient
Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  Doesn't take up much suitcase space.
Gets rid of the frizzies.  Perfect!
Searched high and low for a good quality,  stylish and affordable hair dryer. This is perfect....<br />I've had it a while now (over a year) and I am still happy to have found this.  I really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button - allows me to pack it away nice and easily.  Everything else works as described.
Had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord!! I was very excited to see that. Works great, but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time I use it more than 10-15 minutes (might just be our place but we live in a townhome).
Works great, light weight, easy to handle.  Just what I was looking for..
The wife says to give this dryer 5 stars. She really likes it!
Perfect
Love this little guy.  Good for short to medium hair, but not for long hair.  Nightlite is nice touch.
I have several of these hair dryers. I keep one as a back-up in case my other one breaks. It works well, puts out good heat and I love the colors.
muy bueno
Great product, highly recommended.
I first used this hairdryer at a hotel. It is definitely one of the best hairdryers I have ever owned. It is small and compact, and folds nicely. It also has a retractable cord, which is a huge bonus. As far as drying goes, this dryer did a great job on my hair. I have thick, coarse hair that is about shoulder-length. The airflow is excellent, and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time. It is also surprisingly quiet (as quiet as a hairdryer can be), even on the high speed. I highly recommend.
Great product! my Kids like it!
super product!
Great dryer. Never gets too hot.
works great!
I use it quite often..Very good for this price. I hardly used the attachment that came with it..
Great hair dryer. I like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time I can dry my hair without heat. Works fine for me.<br />The handle is a little big and awkward to hold when I switch it to my left hand but if I hold it up at the top it's okay. The pros outweigh the cons for me!
Best hair dryer ever. It is very strong and dries your hair right away, it also gives a volume since it is 1600 Watt, the money you pay for it definitely worth it.
My last hair dryer was an Andis and I bought an Andis again because I was so impressed with their quality.  So compact that it fits easily in my suitcase. You feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos.  Great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms!
Excellent product!  Quick attention very well packed and fast! - It is powerful to my wife loves
EXCELENTE
This is like no other dryer I've ever owned.  My 5 year old dryer caught fire . After a few quick looks around my rural<br />town for  any kind of dryer,  (Dryers are dryers. Right?), and coming up empty,  I just went online and with little consideration except price, in 5 minutes I just clicked  the buy button & forgot about it.  When it arrived and I used it , it was a force!  My hair dryed  practically instantly and with added volume.  It has many buttons.  Not sure what all are for.  Can't read them without my glasses.<br />Just pushed them all until I get fastest & hotest.  I can use my round brush & this dryer and dry & style my hair faster than with any of my specialty  hair stylers. Just a few minutes. ( I have shortish hair)  I've got the &#34;Instyler&#34; $100+  & The Pefecter Fusion Styler $100+  & others.  I can't pinpoint why this one works better in lightening speed.... (  I think it was $20 or $30.)....  but it does.  Do yourself a big favor & look no further.  It's no gamble at all. With Amazon you can return it.
It works great, is a little bit heavy but has good power, it heated very well. I am happy with my purchase
luv it.
Works great and always at hands reach. Very satisfied with this product.
Great value for the money. Faster drying without overheating one's hair, when compared to our previous hair dryer.
Love this dryer!! Dries quickly and straightens hair nicely.
great hair dryer
A nice hairdryer.  Strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model.  You can dry your hair in a couple of minutes. Convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that I had for many years.
First used this hair dryer when staying at a motel & had to have it.  I love the retractable cord.
I bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it.  Good power, multiple heat settings, and doesn't have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy.  The vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there... this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer.
Great hair dryer and the as ones used in the salon I go to.
Very pleased with this purchase. The different heat settings is great.
Gets the job done and it is cheap.
Love it
good
its PERFECT and so is Amazon .com
It's very powerful and does not burn my hair
Cute little hair dryer. My younger daughter wanted her own dryer so I got this one. she loves it and so does my older daughter. Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also
My favorite  blow dryer . Very strong and fast. I can browdry my sister's 4a/b curly hair in 20 -30 min and my type 3 hair in 7-10  min.
Everything was very good
it is the good hair dryerï¼I will continue use it to see if my hair can be better. So far is goodï¼?11/27/2014
Yes, please and thank you! I'm so happy with this dryer. I have very thick, coarse hair (4c), medium length. This dryer beat my old Conair dryer hands down - it takes about 30% less time to dry my hair. The design is perfect - comb attachments slide in and stays in place during the entire drying process (my old dryer's comb would always pop off at least twice and I've broken two comb attachments in as many months). I also like the width of this dryer. It does get very hot so use a high smoke point oil like coconut to protect your hair while drying. Bottom line, this is a very good product at a very good price. I also got the Andis flat iron - my new dynamic duo!
My hairdresser uses this blow dryer and recommended it to me when I told him I did not feel mine was powerful enough. This dries my hair in a fraction of the time as it used to take me. I love the adjustable settings for heat and for power, and the Ionic blast button for cold shots is great, too.
Love the retractable cord and the dryer quickly dries my hair.
Ordered as gift and they were thrilled with quality, price and shipping!
Good basic hair dryer.  Like all the rest prolly won't be handed down to my grandchildren, but serviceable.
good product I have nin type of complaint, I am satisfied recommend this seller and product
Very light dryer, and has a nice grip and feel to the handle.  I have very long hair and it dried my hair very fast with very little frizz.  I would highly recommend this dryer.  I love it!
Just like the ones in hotel.
Folds up perfectly, good heat and power.
I am so happy with this dryer! It's not too loud, like the design, and easy to pack. The only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting. I would highly recommend the Andis dryer.
Awesome hair dryer
GREAT dryer for the price...nice features...the light may be just a bit too bright, but if you need a nightlight, its' great.
Love it! Dries hair fast without tangles!
I love this hairdryer because it's small, and lightweight, yet quite powerful, both in heat and flow.  The switch is very easy to use, and I prefer a small white hairdryer to be accidentally seen on the bathroom counter, instead of a huge heavy clunky black and chrome model that doesn't fit in a drawer when I need to tidy up.  This one is also small enough for travel.
Good item
Amazing design! Good power, comfortable to use!
Our old hair dryer has seen better days,so my niece picked this one because pink is her favorite color. Revlon is a name that's been involved with hair,so I said why not. The dryer seems to dry hair well,and my niece likes the color,so it's a win-win!
We liked the convenience so well that we bought one for the guest bathroom too.
I first tried this hairdryer while staying at a Marriott Resort.  I loved it so much that I purchased 3 of them.  It can be set to blow at  the highest power with the heat at a lower setting -- something I found to be perfect for me.
Best dryer out there! use it daily
Love love love this product salon finishing and the cord retracts! Best part had it for over a year it's really good
Really great.  Got it in 2 days on a Sunday.  Thanks.  I love it.
I got the leopard print and it's beautiful!!!<br />this model is a little bit heavier than the Babyliss TT tourmaline titanium (the white one), but it does dry the hair in HALF the time!!! I have long hair around the middle of my back and I dried it completely in 4m25s. With the Babyliss TT it would take about 8-9 minutes. Do this is completely worth it!!!!
so far so good
Exclent product, just two minutes tondy my hair without damage
Good!
Amazing
LOVE this hair dryer! It is excellent for drying curly hair, which needs intense heat in one area. Light weight and not overly bulky, this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile. Curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache, due to the long use. I recommend for anyone who wants a great, affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat!
Works great. I replaced my Sharper Image ion dryer after 10 years with this model. It works great and has the same specs as my other model. Only at a fraction of the price! Highly recommend.
Just received it; yesterday; delivered on time, no problem.  It's so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser & concentrator. But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too. And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms. The diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair; the concentrator straightened my bangs.  I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely. What's not to like?
I have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out. I have always used Con Air products and have been very happy with them. This hair dryer does NOT disappoint.  Great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature I never had that before. It has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair. Love this product and love Conair!
Excellent product.....
Light weight and efficient.  Very easy to use.  Just what I wanted for travel, when I don't want to take my big heavy dryer.
Good solid unit.  Feels super well constructed.  I am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor.  This likely means it will last.  It moves a bunch of air.  It heats quickly and strongly without odor.  Does a terrific job on hair.  Noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving.  The surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use.  My wife loves it.  The buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use.  Neither of use uses the attachments so no help there.<br /><br />While I stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing, I don't feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife.  I guess it depends on your expectations.  It will probably strike some as too heavy.  Not us.
Super Deal.  Super Price.  I bought this on Amazon after reading reviews.  It works great.  I have no complaints whatsoever.
This is a really good hair dryer. Most other models either have low airflow or are very loud and hurt my ears. This one is hot, has high airflow and the sound is soft and easy on my sensitive ears.
Great product and price. Strong airflow and nice setting options. Get's my very long hair dry fast. Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years. Hope this one last as long
This is lightweight and powerful.  I bought three of them so that I could use two as gifts.  I love it.
Dries my hair very quickly, the different heat settings are wonderful! It works perfectly.
T3 makes the best hair dryers. This is my third T3 dryer...the first I had for 4yrs it only broke after being dropped for the tenth time, the second I had for 2yrs it shorted out on vacation in Cuba (no fault of the dryers just my own stupidity, they are made well & to last) and this third T3 I've had for 1yr. I have long, thick, corse, frizz prone hair & used to burn out other hair dryers in only a few uses whereas these T3 dryers dry it super fast with no frizz & it looks shiny after and they last forever. The concentrated nozzle is great for smooth looks and I love the diffuser for beachy waves. Invest in this dryer and you won't be sorry, just don't take it on vacation & it will last for years and years.
mom loves it and it works so I guess it's great.
Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  Really like the way it streamlines the air.  Have not tried the diffuser yet but I am sure it works well.  Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  Only one coil was working.  Dries my hair in about a third of the time.  Would recommend to a friend.
It is hard to find a pistol style hair dryer these day. I assume that majority went less bulky shape because it look nicer. My first priority is quiet operations and this pistol shape produce quieter air flows.
what an ingenious idea!!!  great hair dryer!
This dryer is amazing.
It takes some precision switching fr hot to cool & vise-versa, otherwise it's great & I can mount on the wall folded in half w/no cord.
I have always hated blow drying my hair, but this dryer makes it easier due to the handle being so thin. I usually use it on low settings and it works great. I love this hair dyer.
Perfect size for gym bag
It's the best hair dryer ever! Love it soooooo much. After using it, my hair becomes more shining and healthy. Definitely recommended for everyone!
make hair blowing time a breeze
great Product !
great
Good product and good company to order from.
Works great
It works very good and really worth its price. Recommended +++
arrived as promised
use it every day
Grand budget buy plenty of power and heat and nice and compact too.
I'm glad to buy this dryer. It's powerful enough to dry long hair in a few minutes.
I bought this for my rental and haven't tested it out myself but it's perfect for that.  Not sure about everyday use.
Very very good quality
Love this hairdryer. I found it in a hotel in Houston and had to have one for my own. It blows at a great temperature--just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you--but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer. This is the fastest (and best) dryer I have owned.
Very convenient. Love it. Hve it in every bathroom
good value!
We have used this  for 7 years . We have four and have only replaced 2.  Visitor dropping it, slipped out of hand. Like the ease of use. Speed and form.
not super strong, but does the job. can't beat the price :)
We love it, we put it in our RV because an RV that we owned had one and I think that they should be a standard feature in all RV's
I absolutely love this hair dryer. Its construction makes it easy to handle regardless of which portion of my head I am drying. It also does a beautiful job of drying and subduing the texture of my fine, course 4C hair. I don't have to use high heat to get the results that I am loving, loving, loving.
I have always loved Conair products and used them for years. I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was. I searched on Amazon for the same and/or similar style and came across this. The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it. I have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done! If you're the type of person who doesn't want sore arms when drying your hair, this is perfect for you!
I had used it once in a hotel.  I like it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one, and a big plus is it didn't sound loudly as my old one.  Yes, it's just as what I want.  Then I rushed online, and ordered it.  It's been 4 months since, it's still working good.  Love it.
Super good!
This is a great hair dryer and I love that it hangs on the wall--right where you need it.
This dryer replaced my dryer of 4 years and has a lot of power. I would recommend it to everyone!
Does the job perfectly and fitted my hairdryer with no issues.
This is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag.  What's not to love?  Oh yeah, great job at drying my hair as well!
This item is exactly what I replaced. Thank you
Received on time and as descried.
absolutely Love It!
A great hair dryer.  Excellent features, and very attractive.
Fits great ! Works great!
so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else...
best dryer a gir could ask for.. this is perfect for my natural hair
Works great.
Space saver. Works great
does its job. love the cool sitting and the feel of it.
Works as expected... great.  The individual heat / fan speed controls are a very nice feature.
Love this dryer. Best I've ever owned! Love how it is so quiet as well. Even my son said it's the best.
Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.<br />Its pink but appears purple in the picture, thats the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.
Worked fine for me
My favorite hair dryer over the yrs. Great for traveling as still find the occasional lodging without dryers.
Good buy
Best that i have ever owned.
Love it
So far so good!
Works perfectly. Strong and compact
Replacing earlier unit, same model. Found only on Amazon:)
Love it - not an overly strong blow dryer which I like because I don't have thick hair.  It's nice and light so my arm doesn't get tired.  No frizz either.
I love it....
Good size, good power.
I used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it.  I loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head,  it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what I had used previously.  Before I left the resort I went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then.  I highly recommend this dryer!
Excellent.....
Good quality
I like this hair dryer, it's worth the price. Thank you
Excellent! Finally my hair is like at the hairdresser hahaha
Awesome- worked just like it said it would!
This inexpensive blow dryer works great! I'm an African American woman and my hair isn't straight. This gets it there. My daughter has curly hair and this does the job on hers as well. I love it! It's a quick and easy blow out!
I really like this hairdryer!  I bought it to replace my Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light.  That dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight.  This Sunbeam is wonderful!  It is very powerful and super compact on my wall.  The only complaint I have is that the on/off button are not on the handle but on the hanger.  I prefer it to be on the handle but that is just a personal preference.
Light and very quiet.
Dries my thick hair quickly and makes it really smooth! Awesome!
Works great.
strong wind
Works Great!
I NEEDED A GOOD BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I'M GOING NATURAL AND THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED TO KEEP MY HAIR HEALTHY.THE QUALITY IS NICE AND THE PRICE IS NICER.
Its a hair dryer! Works fine.
I bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs, etc. It has been well worth it! My hair dries more quickly and I'm getting awesome results with my round brush like I usually get at the salon. I would definitely recommend this product.<br /><br />Even though I would recommend this product, I am highly disappointed to find out that buying through Amazon and a 3rd party I am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product. I found this out as I was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in. Had I known this ahead of time I would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid $2 more to have a 1 year warranty. I am returning to Amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20% off and no tax.
excellent
Perfect!
It's a nice hair dryer. Dries hair good. Has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold, warm or hot air. During my life I had different kind of hair dryers, and this one is as good as my other ones. Did not really noticed the difference. But it does what any hair drier suppose to do. And yes, it's made in Thailand.
The only negative reviews I read about this (and all other dryers) is that some die too early. Hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome. It is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space. We are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models. Chose this one after analyzing reviews of all models. It is a little more expensive but well worth it.
Works well. Lite weight for travel or home.
Really nice find.  Saw this first at a prominent New York hotel and thought 'if it's good enough for them ...'  We've been very happy with it.  How long it'll last?  Who knows.  But so far, so very good.
This is the second time i've purchased this dryer. It's long lasting. i had my last dryer for 5 years and it only broke because i dropped it twice really hard on tile floors. It still worked but i could hear it was not doing well so I purchased another one. If you need a diffuser, Bio Ionic Universal Diffuser fits perfectly. This is the best dryer for thick hair and beauties with natural/curly hair textures. Its really strong. I do hair on the side and its perfect for heavy use.
Perfect. Always liked these off the counter dryers in hotel rooms.
Works great and it is nice and compact.
excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto recomiendo a la tienda
I am very surprised to be writing a raving review about a hair dryer.  I never really gave much thought to my hair dryer and the potential damage it could do to my hair.  My last dryer (it was either a Clairol or Revlon-I threw it out after it starting throwing sparks) left my hair extremely dry after approximately two years' use.  I kept switching shampoos and conditioners, thinking that my hair was just changing and I needed to find a new product.  Turns out all I had to do was buy a new hair dryer!  Before purchasing this dryer, I read a few online articles that suggested a lower wattage dryer for fine hair.  That is basically how I ended up with this dryer-it was the lowest wattage dryer (besides a travel dryer) for a reasonable price.  I have only been using it for a few weeks now and the difference in the feel of my hair has been unbelievable - extremely soft!  In addition, the dryer is surprisingly quiet and dries my full head of hair in less time than my prior dryer.  Overall, I recommend this product.
Excellent! will surely buy again. Does the job right.
great buy!
It dries my hair so quick leaving is so smooth, LOVE IT!!!
Perfect for anyone. I use two of these in a rental condo with zero problems.
Wonderful hair dryer.  I bought this one for my camper and after using it I put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house. It dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy.  I was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it I will not use anything else.  I love it!
This is the only diffuser of this variety I've ever found that has short fingers.  Normally the fingers are so long that it is impossible to get the heat close enough to my hair to not take forever to dry.  (I hated those long fingers when I had long hair, and I still hate them now that I have short [not even to my chin] hair!)  This diffuser does blow hair around a bit more than a traditional diffuser (for example, the old school ones w/ the black foam-like material), but this doesn't bother me since my curls are uneven in texture and lend themselves to a beach-y, messy type of look.  Might cause frizz for tight curls, though.
This hair dryer is the best anywhere. This is my second purchase due to one of my granddaughters breaking the previous one. Will order again in the future if need be.
great
small, light, powerful, good amount of heat.
Used this for year, still awesome!
does good
strong powerful air flow, dries hair quickly, nice compact size, lightweight.  Wish it had a better button for controlling the 'shot of cool' setting.
I've used this little guy daily for the past 3 months and I gotta say I love it!<br /><br />My only problem with it is how bulky the plug is. I mean, seriously, if you want it to be a PORTABLE dryer, don't have the end of the cord be almost as big as the handle.<br /><br />In terms of performance, however, I cannot complain.
Very good!  Excellent. It works. I love it!
best dryer I've had in years!
This has to be one of the best hairdryers Ive bought. The plum sparkle coloring is spectacular. It is a little heavy but not real noticeable. The only thing that &#34;erks&#34; me is where the buttons are. If you are use to holding it a certain way, you may have to change that. I miss having a rewindable cord too, but thats okay with me. It is great! My hairstylist even thinks so!
I love it!
GREAT FOR HOME USE !!!!!
Just what I wanted.
Excellent
I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, other than maybe operator error. This hair dryer is great, it dries my hair much faster than my other Revlon which is about 3 years old and I love the different settings. I wash my hair every other day, so it doesn't get daily use, but so far so good. The cord will only retract well if you have the handle extended, if you try to fold the handle and then retract it wont work. It is nice and compact to keep folded in my bathroom.
Blow dryer is awesome!  Works great
I had been using something similar for years.  It had belonged to my 95 year old mother and lasted through her life and most of mine and one morning I turned it on and zilch, it had died.  Since I am pretty much housebound I wondered what to do next.  Good ole amazon came to the rescue.  It arrived much sooner than originally planned and I was delighted.  The equipment works extremely well with various speeds and protective gear for a bathroom switch.  The only fault I found was that there were other pieces for directing air flow that came with no explanation of how to connect them.  I don't use them anyway but it would have been nice to have had some directions especially for the mechanically impaired like myself.  Otherwise a wonderful hair dryer for a cheap price.
good, very strong wind
Good deal
great value.  not a professional one, but great for home use.
Love it so far. Very strong blowing unlike some of the other dryers I've owned.
I have a few of these for different rooms. Works well and cord retractor makes cleaning easy.
I think I should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size, it's definitely a satisfactory for me. Would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck.<br />It does the job really good with 1200W. The nozzle of course helps a lot.<br />I got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can't remember the name and I liked it, but this one is way better.
excelente
This works great I love it.
Good price, blow strong. Not too big.  Love it.
I absolutely Love this Blow Dryer. Its Lightweight, easy to handle, quite and Powerful. Great Buy
I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available. I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

Great heating appliance.  Works great and dries hair quickly.  If you fall asleep under the dryer don't worry the timer will wake you up.
Works great.  I wish the bonnet was larger
I have the full size T3, and I am very happy I purchased this travel size. It really does work to keep your hair less frizzy, and dries really quickly. The folding mechanism works well, so it fits nicely in my carry-on bag. I love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room.
Love this dryer. I have two... One ant home and one at the lake place!
Works great
I absolutely love this dryer. It has simplified my hair routine and save on so much time. I would definitely recommend this.
LOVE LOVE LOVE! this is the best hair dryer I've ever seen. It's really light, very quiet, and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle, which is unexpectedly brilliant. It also folds so it doesn't take too much space in my luggage when I travel. The chord is a bit too short, but with an extension is fine.
This hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous! I didn't think that it would make much difference, but it did!!
best hair dryer ever!!!! i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy. this hair dryer really works with its function choices.
So far so good!  The dryer is very lightweight, which I love.  Love the pink too!  The price was right as well --- all around a good purchase!
as advertised
BEST.HAIRDRYER. EVER!  Love it!
The Best.....
Small but powerful. Dual voltage, great for travel, easy to pack. Very light, so much easierr to work with, than the larger, heavy ones.
Used this at one of top brand name Hotel, Like it very much, air volume is good with reasonable noise. Excellent product.
Excellent First  Introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable and it is.  One has lasted 5+ years with near daily use. New one is for guests. Have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  It happens!
Great blow dryer, great price and very light weight.
I am very happy with the hair dryer so far. It works perfectly. My hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use. I mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters. They have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon. So now I have my own salon at home. I couldn't be happier.
it is so far so good.
Ordered 2 ,they work great!
I LOVE THIS DRYER!!! Salon worthy rollersets every time!  Gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly. Quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone. Fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay. Its a tight fit BUT it DOES fit.
Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!
best dryer ever! time saver, and eliminates frizz, and changed my hair from &#34;drab to fab&#34; :)!
Love love love!!! It's quiet.  My hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer. I can't say anything bad about this product.
Excellent
For the price, a very good and flexible hair dryer. The retractable cord, the many levels of heat and volume add up to a very functional unit.
I love, love, love this hairdryer!! It dries my in half the time my old one did. And it doesn't get hot to the touch like my old hairdryer did. My only complaint is that it's heavier than I expected but not so heavy that it's unmaneuverable.
Very good product, I've been using it for half a year, works good.
Love it!
Thank you
This Conair product is my favorite. This is the best dryer. I have bought it as a back-up for travel to the same<br />model that I bought awhile back. It is a great dryer and functions a long time. My very first was purchased<br /> some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use. I highly recommend it.
glad I purchased 2 one for each bathroom they're great no more looking through drawers to find the hair dryer
I works great and was a good price.
its really amazing! i tried lots of hair products to rescue my sensitive hair and nothing works better than this hair dryer!
It was reviewed as being effective on high selection and not so much on low.  That has proven true but the product meets my needs perfectly.  It was delivered promptly and in excellent condition.
It is an excellent hair dryer. This is the second one we have purchased!
When the right order did come, it was perfect !
Bought two for guest bathroom and so far it's been perfect. Lots of power in a little size
I have been using these dryers for quite a few years and I am fully satisfied with their performance and durability.  My wife, who uses a fancy high power dryer has put hers aside and taking possession of mine. It is small, comfortable to use, dries well and it is quite dependable. You need nothing more.
Excellent, strong, light weight hair dryer for travel and every day. I love it!!
I have used this blow dryer for about three years now and I love it. My daughter is constantly stealing it from me so I just purchased one for her birthday. Would you believe that was her favorite gift?
wicked cute ! great delivery :)
Works very well and a great size
Best blow drier I've ever owned. Light and powerful. The power button is actually 2 buttons side by side. One button controls the heat setting and the other controls the fan speed. I really like this feature because you can set it on low heat and the fan on high.
great for the price
Dries my hair in half the time. Love this dryer!
I love this hair dryer. It really does leave my hair shiny and softer than my old one.
I've had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day I bought it. High-powered and hot, which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush. I really love this hair-dryer, and I take it with me whenever I travel.<br /><br />Update--- 2 years post review and it's still going strong!
excellent product
Very Good Value For The Price... She really likes It because of 2 speeds and 2 heat settings.
Impressed!  At first I thought 1000 watt wouldn't do much, but this Bonnet Hood Dryer packs a punch.  I've used it twice so far and love my results!  This dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses - so honestly, I feel like I got it for free as I don't have to go the salon to get my hair done!  I'm not saying I won't get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until I do.<br /><br />LOVE IT!
Exelente
Does its job at a great price. It's also extremely light weight as well so I carry it in my carry-on bag when I travel.
I love this hair dryer! Not only does it dry very well, but it is extremely light-weight and perfect for travel! It's also not too loud, so it doesn't wake my roommate in the morning.
I love this hairdryer. I ordered it for college and it works great. It's not only small but it also packs a big punch. It warms up quickly and gets the job done. I go home and I hate using my mother's hairdryer because mine is so much better than her expensive, bulky one.
I have purchased these for every bathroom!  Not only are they handy, you don't have to waste space in your drawer.  The night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night.
I love this dryer! Great power!
My third T3!
Excellent portable hair dryer with plenty of power.
The dryer is excellent! Exceeded my expectation.
Great product
Nice little dryerâ€¦fits great on the wall and has a lot of power.
bueno
work great and I'm very satisfied,Great seller! Fast shipping.<br />Great price and Quality product.Loved the item.Will buy from this seller again
Very light & dries hair quickly without frizz.
Quiet and fairly light. dries nicely without scorching. The pink hue on the buttons and filter housing was a surprise, as it didn't really show up in the photo, but , hey, it's just a hair dryer.
Perfect.
This is worth the money.  Don't waste your money on the cheap ones, spend a little extra and get one like this that is good for your hair.
I loved this dryer. It is super light, small and super powerful at the same time. It is very strong and drys very fast. excellent product, I completely recommend.
My wife loved it, it's a big step up from her mothers 1960's, THE HOTS little blue Hair Dryer that has nearly burned down the house at least 3 times already.
Powerful, well-designed and worth the money.
My Elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family.  My hair, while I used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere.  This Elchim showed up and it was like a miracle.  The hair dryer is just amazing.  I read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time I used it, but never again.  It leaves your hair silky smooth!<br />Oh and regarding the heaviness...don't judge a book by its cover.  It is heavy until you use it.  Then magically the weight is distributed nicely.  Don't ask me how...some kudos go to the designers!
This little dryer is my favorite.
Had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year. Yes it worked great..donated it to my neighbor.. this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head. Light weight. go too the Landry room and fold clothes while on my head.<br />Lol..Yes I do plug it in there
so far ok
I couldn't believe I had found such a great quality product for a great price. I was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn't afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer. I did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments I was looking for. I bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn't be as described. I received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels. It also came with the attachments which work great! This blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road. If you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional I definitely recommend this product.
I love my hair!!ðŸ˜ƒ thank you
really niceï¼?10/19/2014
Very nice little hair dryer for the money. Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn't disappointed.
I absolutely love this hairdryer. It looks like I came out of salon everytime.
great product, great price!
Works well and very quiet..
Works great. No shut off like others have said. Well worth my money.
after too many drops it finally stop working. I am surprised it took so long! def. buying another one
good
Turned out to be an awesome product and delivery. Use it everyday!
I used an Andis  hair dryer in a nice hotel in Wichita, Kansas.  When I found one on Amazon, I knew I had to have one.  As usual, my order came quickly and I am loving this hair dryer.  The smaller size plus the plug does better in my receptacle in the bathroom.  It fits nicely in my drawer.  It exceeds my expectations.  I am loving it!
great dryer, easy to put together, gets hot very fast
Enough power and easy to pack/carry.
I had purchased one of these hairdryers previously and, after a few years it died and I needed to replace it.  It's a powerful little device.  I specifically wanted on that I could mount to the bathroom cabinet for ease of use.  I would definitely recommend this product...good product and good value.
Dries my hair in the half the time of any dryer I have used. My husband and kids thank you!
This is exactly the hair dryer I wanted - light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other.  It produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur. And it's got an easy-to-use heat-release button that's very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air. I'm sure it would be great for people, too. but I've never tried it so can't comment on that.<br /><br />One bit of advice - the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord.  Until certain steps are taken, the hair dryer won't work.  Don't try to figure it out on your own, just read the instructions that come in the box.  Once you've followed them, you'll be able to turn on your appliance.  It isn't necessary to do this EVERY time, just the first time, and I'm glad to have the extra safety feature.
reduced drying time on my tricky hair. brush attachment will not go through my hair (used comb attachments only)
great item i will buy again
Folds. Nice. For the small size it dries hair very well. Fits in suitcase very well. The plug is a little bulky but very safe. Good product.
I've used this for a few years now, and it has been flawless so far. I'm hoping it will outlast my need for it.
This is a wonderful addition to my home.  This dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly!!!!  Good buy!!!
pretty good blow dryer. wish it had just a tad bit more power, but honestly, it's not bad. (it's not some cheap hotel-dryer)
Love this dryer.  Replaced my old Sedu one that finally bit the dust.  Leaves hair shiny and silky.  Dries in half the time.  Use on my pet on low setting.  They love it.
I've had this dryer for a few months now and it's fantastic. I have loooooong thick frizzy hair and has cut my drying time in half. Comes in a fancy box, looks nice and shiny and does the job. Since it's a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like. It's not super big so i've even packed it in my carry on for vacation (it's not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers).
I like this dryer.  Much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers.
I like it the cool button is a nice feature.
Excellant
Best hair dryer ever and the price was perfect too
Amazing blow dryer. Almost like a professional kind and for an amazing price.
This is the best dryer I have ever owned, dries your hair so fast!
Just received
My wife loves it....great blowdryer, lots of power.
Great!
EXCELLENT PRODUCT
It's roughly the size of a 5 inch sub from Subway.<br /><br />It dries my hair on two different settings.<br /><br />It feels solid, looks nice with it's black/white colour scheme, and it's now mine.<br /><br />You should buy one too.
I love the distribution of heat it gives. So much better than the bonnet I bought from sally's that you attach to your hand held blow dryer than seemed to push heat to only one main spot. This was worth the investment.
Best dryer I've had, this is my second one...the first one I had just burned out after 17 years that I've had it! Cant ask for more
The wife is happy.
Folds up to just the right size, the retractable cord is convenient, and it works very well without overdrying.
I love it!
Fits my Conair perfectly, works really well.
This hair dryer is AMAZING! I have alot of thick frizzy hair and this blow dryer not only smoothed my ends it did it super fast! Im so happy with my purchase its worth every penny!
Nice to have  the dryer right at hand
loved it - just as I thought it would be like
excellent
This is a great hair dryer for traving. it fold up small and the cord retracts into the dryer at the push of a button. It drys my long, thick hair in record time. I couldn't ask for a better product.
I love it is the best
Love it!!
Great hair dryer. It's kinda heavy it really dries my thick hair fast.  The cold shot is nice and cool.
good
Best hair dryer ever!!!!!
This is an excellent dryer. Could not ask for anything better.
Use every other day and after 3 yrs it is still going strong.
Had it for 2 months now... It's awesome!
I'm so excited to write my review for this one. I was doing research about the best hairdryers, because there are millions of them out there.<br />This one is perfect.  I have waist length, thick, wiry and wavy red hair that really enjoys frizzing and making my life unpleasant.  Finding hair products that work for me, is like my life's mission.  This does get hot! I'm not sure what might be wrong with the other reviewer's products, I think mine gets plenty hot.  Hot enough to dry it fast, without burning the mickey out of my scalp, and man does this thing have POWER.<br />And  its quiet for how much fast air it can blow!<br /><br />I love this, it works great on my hair for volume, or diffusing, and even straightening.  Cuts my hair prep time in half.  Recommend!
Very pleased with quality of product. Thank you!
Great value and works GREAT
Very good
I've used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since I bought it! Arrived via FedEx two days after I ordered it, very easy to assemble and operate. Highly recommended styling tool, particularly for natural hair wearers, or at home hair style mavens. My friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers! Offers high heat or cool temperatures, and has a built in timer. Easy to move around as needed. Would totally buy again!
ðŸ‘
good in quality, easy to use, quick dry
very good! light and very little noise, dual voltage dries your hair soon.
I like it! I didn't review it for a couple months to see if it died early, but no, it's going strong. Way loud, but really strong and I love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag. Me likey!
Great hair dryer!
Love the color works well
I have very curly and voluminous hair and this dryer was my best investment. I usually dry my hair on high/cold and it takes less than 10 minutes which saves me time and energy. I also use the dryer when i want to straighten my hair and it's amazing and dries my hair in rollers really fast.
Love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus.  It does not have heat settings but that's not a problem.
My wife loves it and if she is happy, I'm happy !!!
Great dryer at a very reasonable price!  Has more than enough power to get the job done quickly and is very convenient by being always accessible.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.
Fantastic Blowdryer.<br />Was looking for something that had some heat options and this fit the bill.<br />It actually dries my super thick long hair quicker than my last one.<br />I highly recommend this dryer.
Im in love...the best blow drier ever.
I bought this to replace my ancient Conair dryer. This one is much quieter and dries a lot quicker.  *Edit & Update 01/31/2017  I am still using this dryer and it still works great.
Love it
Excellent hair dryer.  Light weight, easy to use and compact.  Love it!
My old hair dryer died.  I wanted something small and lightweight so my arm wouldn't get tired.  This works great.  Dries my hair fine, I do have short hair though.  I don't think I will ever use the diffuser and the other doohickey.  Very satisfied.  I also like the pouch.  Nice for travel.
Nice, small compact blowdryer with alot of air flow.
This is my favorite hair dryer and it's the third I've owned.
I bought the same model Conair 9-10 years ago, and have usually used it every day. It still works.  I bought it again just to have when the other must surely ultimately die.<br /><br />Product longevity is why I bought it again.
I had my last one of these for about 8-10 years. It finally went kaput.  My 19 year old had been sharing it - yeah that is a lot of blow drying.  This one is exactly the same and I hope to get another 8-10 years out of it.
Great hair dryer!  Nice size with great features!  My daughters love it.
excellent product
I have thick, thick hair.  I have envied the speed with which my hair dresser dries my hair - and finally gave in and purchased the hair dryer she uses - the 3200 Twin Turbo.  I may not have the expertise she has in using it, but my goal has been achieved - my hair is dried SPEEDILY.
Works great.  I've had it a couple of months and still working fine.  Blows hard, gets hot.  Variable settings.  Long cord and relatively quiet.
Excelente
Great wind, and does not hurt my hair that much!!
Best blow dryer ever. Very powerful.
works great.
i absolutely love this hair dryer! i cant believe i waited so long to buy one. great for roller sets ( my 2 1/2&#34; rollers are almost too big- they barely fit , i think a 2&#34; roller would be more comfortable) and deep conditioning treatment, i do one almost everytime i shampoo now its that easy. it is large and raising and lowering the bonnet is not easy but it only takes about 15 minutes for my hair to dry with a roller set at the setting on 60, you cant beat that! no more tugging and pulling on my fragile bleached hair to blow dry it ( which takes me about a half a hour) i just sit and relax for 15 minutes and then touch the set up with a flat iron. i would buy this over again in a heart beat!
Really good product!
I ordered this because I needed the come that it came with but as it turns out this blow dryer has blown my mind. It's fantastic! !
Great especially for the price
Loved this hair dryer--did not make the bathroom hot.  Lasted 2 years, then it wouldn't turn on and had to replace
Powerful and compact.  What I was looking for.
Absolutely love. Im a male african american and i have very course hair. With a round brush it gets my hair straight without needing a flat iron. It even dries my hair completely with cold air! My conair never was able to do that. Simply amazed with it. It id definitely worth the price.
The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.
Still using this after a year.....love the retractable cord
Simple and functional. Great price. Works well so far....:)
I love this product
Works great and love the rewind!
This hairdryer is the best! Not very large and fits conveniently on the wall, right by the sink. My husband got the idea from a hotel room and it's one of the best purchases we've ever made.
My wife says it works great. I had to order it online. The one she had for several years was not performing like it did when she first purchased it (over five years ago.). She would not buy a different type at a store. She would olny accept this one. I am glad I found it for her.
awesome i loved it
Handy on Wall
This unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price.  We would recommend this if you're looking for a lightweight, portable dryer.
This product runs quieter than I'd imagined and works absolutely great. Highly recommended.
good
I love this dryer!!!!  It is quieter than other dryers that I have owned and dries my hair in half the time.  It is a little heavier, but it is very well balanced so I don't notice anymore.
This works very well for a travel blow dryer.
worth the expense
Very happy with it!
Fits on the very skinny nozzle of my Deva Curl Dryer. Does a great job. The part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths. I don't think it will fit on very large (wide width) dryer nozzles though. I love it.
Powerful but quiet.
Great hair dryer!!
Teen daughters love this hair dryer.  Takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter.
great! it is small and light but blow quickly.
Bought this a a gift for my wife. She loves it and loved how it shortens the drying time. Wen My mother comes for a visit from out of town she loves it as well and would get it if she hadn't just recently bought a lower model.
The wind is strong enough~
Great brush for getting in the gum line. Bred ommended by my hygienist.
very good product~
A gift to one of my daughters for Christmas and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine!
I use it every other day to dry my hair because I always wash hair at night. It is very useful to me. It has good quality and strong wind. And it looks pretty.
Love this little blow dryer than has more power than my big expensive salon dryer.  Great for travel.
Used this for our trip to Europe with no issues.
I have long wavy/curly hair and I've never owned a hair dryer. I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!
For mom and it works great.
you cant beet this dryer at any price.
As strong as a big dryer. This is my 2nd one. The old one still works great. And I've had it 8 years! Perfect for traveling.
Love this product. Have had it for years and it still works great. Drys my hair in no time at all.
Easy to tote around.  Small and light enough to keep in my gym bag.
Excellent, practical, very good product.
Has always been my favorite blow dryer.  Love it
I love this hairdryer. It does blow HARD on the high setting, which is exactly what I wanted. I also love the hot, medium and cold settings. You can set it there and go on your way - unlike other hairdryers where you have to hold down a &#34;cold&#34; button to get the cold air. I try to use the medium setting as much as possible to limit the heat damage to my hair. The only thing that would make this hairdryer better is a retractable cord! :-D
Good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife.  You can feel the quality while using.
Great value. Really like the 2 speeds
Powerful hair dryer for a travel model
AMAZING HAIR DRYER!!! Some of the attachments don't work all that great but the power of the dryer itself and the comb attachment make drying your hair as easy as brushing!
Awesome!! best hairdryer I have ever had
None available.
This is a nice, lightweight hairdryer.  Use this one over my old one all the time now even though I specifically bought it for travel.  Like the feel of it in my hand, and puts out less heat than my other one.  I recommend this dryer.  Does a great job on my short, thick hair and dries quickly.
I just returned from 3 weeks in Italy and France.  This dual voltage hair dryer worked perfectly!
These are super handy. Just like a hotel at home.
Love the size, love the color, it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat.
Haven't had a new hair dryer in many years and I just love this one.  It's light enough for me to handle and yet strong enough to do the job.  Thank you, Conair.
good price and product
Shiny and looks good. But also works the best!!!
Fast drying time and shine shine shine!!!
It works as advertised without problems.  It just has limited options except speed.
Great~
Working great so far!
Works really well!
Purchased as a replacement. Good dryer!
This is an amazing hair dryer!  Very quiet but powerful.  It leaves my hair soft and silky.  The best hair dryer I have ever owned!
This is a great hair dryer. Exactly what I was looking for - controls for both the temperature and fan speed. Highly recommend!
Wife swears that there is magic in the Ceramic...<br /><br />Tells me all Hyatt Hotels have them in their rooms...<br /><br />What do I know?
nice and compact!
I've only used this once, so I don't know if it was a fluke or my imagination, but my hair does seem particularly nice and soft today.<br /><br />I have long hair and did not experience my hair getting stuck in the fan, although I know that can happen with any dryer. I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders. With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.
Quiet and fairly light weight. I have very long hair that usually takes 20+ minutes to blow dry. I use the medium temperature setting and it takes me still close to 20 minutes, but my hair is so soft afterwards that I don't even mind!
Good running smooth
Girlfriend and lady friend both use it.
I saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful.  I don't find that, but it's quite adequate.  It IS heavy and big, but I'm ok with it, and I'm tiny.  I don't see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling, which this does.  I love the low noise level, as it is right by my ear, I've had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past.  The only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle.  I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.  Sometimes I grasp the blower part like pros do in salons, thank goodness for its low vibration.  Just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way.  Oh well, still a great dryer overall.  I've had it a year already.
Excellent product!
Great my wife loves it, happy wife happy life!!!
My wife says that is faster do her hair with this one. And I can tell LOL
love the  convenience
Works great. Have had it about a year. So nice to have it on the wall out of the way.  Easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean.
Great hairdryer!
Great product. Love it!!!
I have bought 4 of these over time and they are very handy for the bathroom.  Eliminate that struggle to locate a hair dryer.
Easy to install,  Makes for a great night light in the bathroom with the blue little LED colored light strip, Works fabulously
Love it, nice size now I need one with dual voltage for traveling overseas.
Works very well not as hot or noisy as most. It takes longer to dry hair.
Took this one to Europe and it worked great. Make SURE you switch it from 110 to 220 when you travel to a country with 220 voltage!
My original own died after dropping it several times. Loved this dryer so replaced it. Gets hair dry fast and is not too loud.
This is my second purchase of this Model Hair dryer..  The first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day!! So, I was happy to find that they still make this model,  very powerful and doesn't clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached.  FIVE  STARS FOR SURE!!!!!!
A powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet! Gets my hair nice and smooth if I blow dry it straight. Also love that it came with a diffuser for when I want to dry my hair curly.
Very convenient and portable. This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting.
I've been using this little powerhouse since 2002 and just now on my third Conair. It Last's a long time and was thankful it was still around so I purchased two this time. Just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that's caught on the grate or it becomes to hot. It get's very hot already but I've never had one burn out like other brands.
great item!
Purchased for my friend. She states it works well.
I recommend this product , it's hot, powerful and will dry your hair quickly.
IT HAS GREAT POWER AND WORKED GREAT ON OUR TRAVELS TO EUROPE.
Love it
Chord works fine, switches loosen up. Good price.
quick delivery, great product, thank you!!<br /><br />easy to use, light and attractive.
Love it! What a great price and it works great! Used it in a hotel a few years ago and when my current drier died I got this one! Even if this one doesn't last long I will probably buy it again! The power is great!
I LOVE IT!
This hair dryer is the best !!  I have very long hair and it dries my hair in minuets.  It used to take me 20 minuets to dry my hair.  Now with this great dryer it only takes me minuets.  This saved a lot of time in the morning.  I can dry my bangs in seconds. They come out perfect every time.
This hair dryer is just what I need.
long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face. Perfect for travel, although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle, and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology
Great guest room gift
Dries my hair in half the time as my old hair dryer.
Perfect for international travel. Works perfectly
Don't understand everyone's negative reviews about this dryer.  It dries my hair in half the time my old dryer took, it is no louder than any other blow dryer I've ever used, the controls are not difficult to use at all (you just push them upwards, for heavens sake!), and the retractable cord retracts exactly as it should.  The best thing is, even with all the positive things about the dryer, it didn't cost an arm and a leg like some I looked at.  &#34;Sticker&#34; shock indeed.  I love it!
great product, quality shipping
Product is works as described. It is smaller in size than expected, but that is a good thing. All heat and speed settings work. Would recommend.
a little big than I think ,but just ok
i have very long and thick hair. this drys my hair very fast! would recommend it
Works great! A fantastic blow dryer for the price.
it good with the cool wind
It is very good and easy to use
I LOVE THIS!  I  have average hair thickness. I love this drier. It's small and light and easy to manipulate.  It has a good blow strength.  Its my second one.  The first one lasted 5 years, but it was only $15.00. I am ok with that. I like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self- style.
Works great, quiet, lightweight
Great product
it is great. It came to my home with no damages and it has a good  price
So far this works great. I read some complaints about it not being powerful enough, but that's to be expected with a QUIET hair dryer. I live in a townhouse so I would prefer a quiet one over a powerful one, so it works great for me. It is also really convenient having it hang on the wall. Hanging it up was a little annoying, primarily because a screwdriver that uses bits is too wide to fit in the holes, but once I borrowed a regular screwdriver from work it went okay. I would say the high on this dryer is a little more powerful than the low on a regular one, but it still only takes me about 3-4 minutes to dry my waist long thin hair.
Excellent hairdryer for the price
This medium size dryer is great.  It dries my medium length hair so fast it's a real time saver.  It's rather quiet compared to all of the other dryers I've owned.
Stayed at a hotel that had this specific dryer. It worked so well, I ordered it from amazon before I even returned home for the trip!
I used this dryer for the first time yesterday for my deep conditioning treatment and let me say, AWESOME! It distributes heat so evenly that when I took the cap off the conditioner penetrated really well! I love it!
Powerful little travel dryer.  I actually used this in England as well as on my US vacations.
Great blowdryer, works as good as any I've used before. Looks great. Lots of blow dryers are tacky and come in ugly colors. And also really heavy. This gets as hot and works as well as more expensive, heavier ones I've seen. Love that it's light weight and solid black.
It's a great dryer and is drying my hair faster.  I choose 2600 as I have fine hair and didn't feel I needed the 3200.  The dryer is nice and QUIET, but is a bit heavy not crazy heavy.
I love it!<br />I used this dryer when I stayed at the Hyatt and decided to order one for myself
Outstanding hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord and the collapsible neck for storage purposes.
Very good product
Great hairdryer! Options for speeds & options for heat settings - exactly what I wanted. And quieter than my last one, which was a bonus! And a fun red, sparkly color too!
This dryer is the perfect combination of small size, power and quick drying.  I purchased one several years ago and when it finally died I tried to replace it with a more expensive and larger one, but wasn't as happy with that one so I bought another one of these.  Is it perfect? No, but pretty close.  I haven't had the problems that others have had.  If it were redesigned I would suggest making the switch a bit easier to move and make the focus attachment stay in position more securely (it spins around too easily).
Love this dryer. Good delivery.
The hair dryer is inexpensive and is working very well.
very good
Works great for me.  I have limited space and really like how the cord retracts.
It's been more than a year since I made this purchase (dropped it a few times) and the dryer works like new.
Excellent.
I ordered this product and it took 10 days before I received it. I live in Seattle and it was shipping from Florida, that's probably why it seemed like forever waiting but I have no regrets...This hooded dryer is just amazing, I wonder what took me so long! My husband put it together as soon as I received and he did it so fast so am guessing assembling is easy ( I was not there when he did it), I was washing my hair ready to try it out. . The results? Simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers...I'm excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results. You can move it around the house and you don't need a special chair. I used the middle, yellow settings and it dried my hair okay. The dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud. I would highly recommend it.
I needed a blow dryer this works perfectly
I don't ask for much from a blow dryer. Compact size and reliability. I had an identical model branded with a different name that lasted me 12 years. After approximately 4,300 uses the mechanical switch broke so I needed a new one. Can't beat the price. BTW, when I disassembled my old one to see if I could fix it I noticed the 120/240 volt &#34;switch&#34; did not seem to be connected to anything.
love it
Love this hairdryer. Had another one I bought ten years ago that finally gave out. Immediately purchased this and hung it right up. Gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom
Great Job!
Was everything they said it was takes up very little space and does the job
Works perfect & works wonders. :)
Small did not think was gonna be so small but overall really powerful for size
I love this hair dryer! After using so many wall hanging dryers while traveling when I saw this one on Amazon it was mine!!! It's quieter than my expensive old dryer. I plan to put one in my 2 guest bathrooms. So simply to hang I did it myself!. The night light is a nice feature. I've seen some reviews that says the light is too bright. It's not. I'm going to give family and friends this hair dryer for Christmas presents! Thanks again Amazon I can find anything here and I love my Prime Membership my Husband suggested. He has his own Prime account!
love it
Everything was great
Amazing Product!!! I Love It
Great dryer.  Fits in a small space.  Very convenient to use.
love it! very good quality for the price / easy to assemble/ the temperature levels are great dries quickly/ silent makes no loud sounds except for the timer button when ready is very loud . over all a great dryer to have at home with salon quality .
I have had a few Conair hair dryers, but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag!
Awesome blow dryer, and flash of cold heat, Love the way my hair feels Thanks Amazon!!!
I read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy, one even called it a brick. I don't find it to be very heavy. It did have a strong plastic kind of smell, but it has faded away. I think it was just it being brand new. I also found this price to be amazing compare to retail. Have noticed my hair being more healthy. I stopped using this 4-IN-1 oil stuff because it over does it. It sure beats my old Revlon blowout hairdryer. It also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair.
I made a great lady happy with the hair dryer.
Great value for low price. It's not too loud and has the power you expect from an 1875 watt dryer.
I love this little dynamo.  I bought it for travel and when my home dryer broke I used this little wonder.  It works better and faster than any dryer I've ever used.
Excellent
I love this hair dryer. I bought it 4 years or so ago and just recently bought another one because I am living between 2 cities and wanted one in each of my bathrooms.
This hair dryer has been amazing. I have very curly hair that is sensitive to heat and I found that this hair dryer does not dry my hair out. I am a sceptic at heart and have been disappointed by many dryers but I have to confess than after a few months of use it has improved my hair. I do find that my curls are less frizzy and do not tend to dry out as much thoughtout the day. I have never found drying my hair an enjoyable experience until now. This dryer is not cheap but not the most expensive either and well worth the price. I will be buying the flat iron in the future!
Works great, very compact.
Love this hair dryer. Heats up nicely. Light weight can sit anywhere comfortably. Works like a charm. I definitely recommend this particular hair dryer to any one. The bonnet is very large, durable and adjustable. Will probably never purchase the hard hair dryer again. It has a. Compartment for the bonnet and the power cord. Real easy to use.
EXCELLENT product. Very compact.
Compact and powerful.  Just what I was looking for.
My mother used this in a hilton and loved it so she came home and asked me to purchase it for her.  Small and convenient!
Dog hates it but it works great plus it's cute
Great for travel.
I LOVEEEEEEEEEE IT
best little hair dryer I've ever owned
Great product! I love it!
Great for my small hands. Love it
I highly recommend this product because it does<br />work great.
I am very happy with the wall mounted hair dryer---Night light is also very nice
Great ; little dryer for Africa!
Great convenience and space saver.
Perfect!
Has everything I need. It does just what it says.Now that's what I call &#34;spending your money wisely&#34;
I've had it for nearly 2 months now and it works just fine. Good price for the quality and brand!
Great for personal use and for one person using daily. It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area.
This is the best, fastest hair dryer I've ever used. Unbelievable. Used it in a Marriott a month ago, ordered on-line and I'm thrilled. No comparison to any other hand hair dryer.
Works great.  No complaints
Great product
Just amazing! easy set up,,and it is just absolutely just amazing it gets very hot three seting. And its quite . I was using it one day and my husband came in from work and said &#34; why are you just sitting under that aren't you goning  to turn it on&#34;
I am happy with the Andis 30975/HD-10L.  The night light is very bright but I close the door to the bathroom and it doesn't bother us when we are sleeping.
It was exactly what I thought it would be. It is tremendously quiet and dries on a &#34;medium&#34; setting, the highest temperature option is too hot. When you sit to dry your hair, an office chair won't do. You must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand. I am happy with it.
I absolutely love the settings on this thing. Very adjustable and not as noisy as expected. On top of that it has a very beautiful color, and it also has heat settings for those days that you don't feel like damaging your hair. Very good!
greatï¼?8/31/2014
The best $40<br />I ever spentâ™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡
Satisfied
Really nice hair dryer.  I love the cold setting and it is not a puny amount of air!  Does a nice job and is easy to use.  Not too clunky or loud.  I like it.
Dries your hair really fast!
Love my hair with this new dryer!!!
We use this to dry off baby butt when doing a diaper change. I mounted it right next to the changing table, and it is flawless. Easy to install, has it's own night light, and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re-holster it when its on! Great product!
Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel. This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use. Can't live without it.
The hair dryer is lightweight and dries my hair quicker than my old one.  The price was very reasonable. Overall I am pleased with the performance although I have only had it for about six weeks.  Its durability remains a question.
I have natural 4c hair. My hair is very thick and coarse. This dryer is the best ever. It straightens my hair quickly and very nicely. You cannot go wrong with this dryer. I love it.
Dries hair. Pretty cheap, but effective.
I hate having to buy a new hair dryer. After reading all the reviews AND finding this in Amazon warehouse I'm thrilled with the Turbo Power 3200-wish it was pink but oh well.
Replaced my old (20 years old) Oster with new one.  It works just as good.  I have no<br />regrets.  Great product
Great hairdryer!  Used one for several days in a hotel in Canada and liked it so much I ordered it when I got home.  Sort of rubberized handle makes it non-slip, has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow, very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired, not as loud as so many others are, does a great job.
Right after I first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a California motel, I have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms.  I have used competitive designs in other motels, but find that this one is still the best, and is reasonably durable.  Based on my experience, I would guess that a unit is good for about 3,000 uses, at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use (not counting the cost of electricity).  In addition to high  and low fan settings, It also has two power (heat) settings; 1200 Watts and 1500 Watts; I prefer the higher one. The unit is shipped with the 1200 Watt setting.  In order to set it to 1500 Watts, you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch.  You can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit.  You may need to experiment some and use some sharp U-turns to get the length just right for your situation. You should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow, and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector. I use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod.  It fits just right into the pry notch. I too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model, but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit.  When you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip, it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in; the newer model uses a magnetic mount. You don't have to jam it in, but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand.
Love this little dryer. I want one for my bathroom. Using in my daughters bathroom but do plan to travel with it.
good
Purchased for fast and efficient drying capability.
Bought it as a gift.  She loves it.
Got it fast and have enjoyed it
fast shipping from Japan & excellent for my fine Asian hair!
Works great
So far so good.  Light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold.  Just hope it holds up.
The product arrived and it is fine  We replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped.  We like the new unit fine.
This looks nice and is very convenient.  I especially like the little hook for hanging the cord up out of the way.  Has a lot of power for a little dryer and looks very nice and compact in my bathroom.  I would recommend this product.
Best hair dryer I've ever owned. I have long thick hair and I can dry and style it in half the time my old dryer took!
Dries my hair in half the time.  The attachments are great and the frizz is gone!
Perfect Size and Power!
very good for my hear,make shaun!!
amazingï¼you can feel the change, make you hair perfect!
At first I thought that the light would be a negative but it works great as a night like when we have to get up at night.  And the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn't take as long to dry my hair.  Thank you for your prompt service.
This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!
Great
Works just great!  Price is right, dries fast, I really like it.
geat
EVERY USE AND HOME
I love this hairdryer. It is nice and quiet and easy to handle.  So far so good!
It is a little heavy, but it is great for drying! All of my stylists use these!
I actually ordered this for my sister. She lives in the Houston area and has very thick, frizzy hair and all the hair dryers we tried locally really just didn't do the trick. This dryer is hot (but not to hot) and blows very strongly and allows her to dry her hair quickly before she gets too hot herself. Good product.
Most people would call this a travel hair dryer.  I don't travel, but I have short arms and don't like most hair dryers that have a long nozzle on the front.  When my last dryer died, I couldn't find anything like it locally.  I finally tried looking for Andis online and was thrilled to find this.  I hope it lasts as long as the last one did.
Wonderful product..fabulous to have on the wall...not noisy. Who doesn't enjoy a product..as advertised!<br />Makes me feel like I'm at a 5 star hotel...being pampered.
This is a back up for the one just like it, only a different color. Lots of power.
***** exwife seemed to like it.
Best purchase EVER!!! Well worth the price!!! I have very thick hair and this cut my drying time by 30 minutes...
good
I travel for work a lot and many of the hotels where I stay provide the Andis Ionic ceramic hair dryer in the rooms.  Really like the results so I decided to order one for home.  Light weight, not too loud and easy on the hair.  For the price, I highly recommend this dryer.
It works much better than the last one, really professional dryer
Nice product and a great price
This is the only brand I trust. I tried many many hairdryers, and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option. This hairdryer is the last one you will ever need. It has two settings high/low, and it just works.
Just what we needed for our travel bag.
A couple months in and so far so go.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Light and comfortable<br />- Nice attachments<br />- No burning smells<br />- Powerful enough<br />- Long Cable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Not very portable<br /><br />The lightness can make it feel kind of cheap but I would rather it be light than unwieldy<br />-
Good product, quick delivery
Excellent! I had a conair turbo bird that I bought back in 2004 that has something rattling inside of it so before it goes out on me I wanted to have a backup. The silverbird has delivered the same great results so far. I look forward to using it for another decade before I replace it!
excellent product it has nine month working without problems, i recommend it
Great Product!  Easy to use, quite stylish (and how important is that when one is blow drying their hair!).  Dries hair quickly without any frizz.  The cord even retracts!  It has multiple heat and power settings.  Appears to have a long shelf life, unless you drop it.  Word to the wise,  take care not to drop it on a hard floor.  This is my second one.
This hair dryer was recommended by my stylist over and above the dryers sold in the salon. This hair dryer has not disappointed! I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly! Worth the $$
Great & great color,very string. It's my 2nd one. Second because I lost 1st one due to my house burning.
buenisimo
Thank you!
Love it!
easy to mount and dries hair very efficiently without counter clutter.
Great hair dryer. I have coarse, thick hair that retains water really well. This dryer has enough umph to do the job.
Great dryer.... if you have hair.
Very good for the price. It used to take me 30 minutes to dry my hair, its very long and thick - now it only takes 15 minutes or less and there is a cool setting, so i can finish up with that to bring the temp of the hair back down and lock in the style.
Good quality for the price!
Exactly as expected
I'm an artist and I needed this to help dry my artwork. It works great for that! There's a low setting that I use if I have &#34;puddles&#34; in my watercolors, and a high setting if the painting is just soggy.<br /><br />I really don't use it as a hairdryer, so I couldn't tell you how well that works, haha. But it's super reliable, compact and I have literally never had any problems with it. Maybe the cord could be longer in future designs- I don't think most people will take issue with that though, because typically there is a plugin right next to bathroom sinks in every house. For an artist though, having a longer cord would be handy. That said, I am totally happy with it the way that it is.
LOVE this hair dryer. I stayed at a hotel that had an Andis dryer in it, and immediately fell in love. It's very powerful (I use the low setting every day), and it dries my hair very quickly. I have thick, long hair, and it takes about 8 minutes.
Great to find a compact hair dryer with this level of wattage.
Exactly what we were looking for.
Great Product!! Thank you.
This is my Conair dryer.  All of them lasted very well.  I just love that it hangs up out of the way in the bathroom.  Hope they never quit making them.
Best hair dryer ever especially for the price.
Great, solved my problem of misplacing my hair dryer.
Love this blow dryer! It's a beast and my hair loves it. My hair is softer. I didn't realize how much I needed a new blow dryer until this. It's amazing.
Fast shipping, easy to assemble (even though the &#34;directions&#34; are just pictures) and works great! I have very short 3b hair and I only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair and it looked great!
Excellent product, light, powerful, durable. We have bought several for our kids.
very good!
Powerful and not too loud
Perfect !<br />Temperature adjustments, blow dry option are completely satisfactory.<br />Color looked different in picture but,  in real it looks very good.
This dryer is smaller and lighter than I had expected.  I can travel with it easily, saving myself the hassle of getting a smaller, less functional travel dryer.  It also dries your hair in 5 minutes flat and does all the other great things other people have mentioned.
Read all reviews and still bought this dryer, I think some people expect to much from a product so far this dryer is doing what I expected it to do. The retractable cord is working and the handle folds like it should and provides proper heat and cooling.
The Onei MK-II hair dryer is an excellent way to reduce frizz when drying while styling.  I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer.
Gift for my wife.  Received quickly and just as described
Lots of power and is an excellent addition to our bathrooms.
This delivers more blowing power than I have experienced before, which requires me to use the middle setting for my long, curly hair. My husband likes the high setting for a quick dry. Perfect for both of our diverse needs.
EXCELLENT
Have had this hair dryer for years and love it. Gets nice and hot without burning me, speed is good, no complaints.
Love it! My tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins.. This takes an hour to dry and is super quiet.i  It is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom - the old dryer folded and I stored in my closet.  This is too big to fit in there,, but I'm glad I purchased it.
Great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.
my favorite hairdryer.  I have been using this for years! Professional dryer
This worked great, with the appropriate adaptor, when I used it in Italy.  In fact, it worked better than the one in the hotel bathroom that was made for use in Europe.
Other than the pink trim [looks silver in photo], excellent dryer. Solid feel and powerful.
I like it very much! :)
Bought one for my daughter and my wife tried it once and so I had to order her one also...seems to be the best they have used and is a great company...
As described. On sale.  Thank you!
Absolutely loved it!  Ordered a second one  I liked it so well.
Good product, worked well.
Took to Argentina for a month and it worked great.  I actually like it better than my regular hair dryer.  Just follow the directions for dual voltage and you will have no problem.  This does not come with an adaptor which I had to bring myself.
It's great works good and was just what I needed for traveling
Good price,  light weight.  Works good!
Good drying power in a small, very packable dryer.  Delighted to find it here.  Bought one for my daughter as well.
Everything I wanted in a hair dryer!  Power!!!!!
fast shipping.very good dryer.
I ordered this hair dryer for my sister and wasn't sure it would be a good one. It seemed cheap but I ended liking it better than mine, which cost twice as much! It's very light weight and not very loud at all. Since it isn't very loud, I didn't expect it to be very powerful but it dries my hair much faster than most hair dyers I've used. We've had it for over 6 months now and it's still working great! It's definitely a great hair dryer at a great price!
Have had this for 2 years now. Paid $25.00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong. VERY happy:)
Loved
I love this blow dryer I got it for 10 on Amazon you cannot find this any cheaper matter fact the next cheapest was 20it works great was brand new came with everything and was on time recommendperfectly satisfied
I like it thanks
this is a great powerful hair dryer
Good hair dryer, especially for the price!
I'm super happy with this purchase (already bought 2) and might get another one.  The price is right and it works really well.
My wife wanted an &#34;old fashioned&#34; hair dryer so I bought her this one and she is a very happy camper.
Strong blow dryer. Had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside so I decided it was time for another one.  I use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long.
Very powerful dryer and in Europe I only needed to use it on the low because it dried as if it was on high.  I still use it at home and here I use the high setting.  Great Dryer!!
My wife loves this great pick up buy this people
Good quality for the price!
Amazing for a small hair dryer.  Folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer.  Has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did when I first got it.<br /><br />Also has a safety GFCI breaker on the plug, which is just more of a testament to quality, but can also save your life if you're using this somewhere that doesn't have one.
Works wonderfully. Nice and hot and does the job.
Great machine.. It gets extremely hot, but it's what I prefer.
I have a hair dryer with higher wattage than this one.  It keeps overheating and switching to cold air.  When it cools down, it goes back to hot.  It takes forever to dry my hair as cold air does nothing.  I was in a hotel that had this hair dryer.  It's lower wattage, but it took less time to dry my hair because it did not overheat.  When I got home from vacation, I decided to see if I could find the same hair dryer on Amazon.  This is exactly the same one as in the hotel.  I ordered it.  I received it quickly.  I LOVE IT.  I love that it's mounted on the wall.  I love everything about this dryer.  Don't let the lower wattage fool you.  This seems as hot as my other dryer.  It must be a little less, because it never overheats, but you wouldn't notice it.  I can dry my hair faster with this dryer.
Works well, no issues.
Love it!  Very gentle on your hair.  No more heat damaged hair. In 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without.
my wife is very happy with her new blow dryer
This model does NOT have the ion feature. I like that, but I don't  use it to dry hair.
Ive been blowdrying my hair for years why didn't I buy this sooner?! It dries my hair in half the time
Exceptional dryer...I love this hair dryer!<br />It is quiet, really quiet for a powerful dryer.  It's comfortable to use/hold.<br />I am really glad I chose this one.  There is nothing negative for me to say.<br />I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the Ovente X3.
I use it to dry my hair 2x faster than with my old dryer, a lot of volume. love it!
I've used this band of hair dryers of 15 years now. They are well made and do last a long time. I'm on my third one. They are very easy to replace. Just remove the hair dryer and cord from the new one and place on the wall holder and plug in. No need to pull the unit base from the wall and mar your paint or paper.
excellent product, works fine. recomended
Quick delivery, great price.
Excellent product!
Awesome hair dryer.  Dries my hair faster than other dryers I have used. I have the matching flat iron too. Great products.
Dries faster than I expected. Cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging.  Love the night light.  Just enough light.
Excellent purchase. Materials are a little bit cheap, but it seems pretty solid in case it drops.
bought this for an elderly neighbor who does not do very<br />much outside her home<br />she replaced her broken down model with it<br />so I was happy to help her out<br />much appreciated
Great value and excels our expectations. Convenient, priced right and a perfect addition to our bathroom!
Very nice and like the filter cover.
Great backup hair dryer for my guest bathroom.
Hasn't broken yet. Blows hot air. Review over.
Small enough for travel and does the job.
This thing is great.  I mounted it in our bathroom and my wife quit using her hair dryer at her make-up station and starting using this one instead.  the nightlight is a nice bonus feature.  There are no heat settings.  The default heat setting I would say is medium.  It is not quiet, but I don't think it is louder than other hair dryers.  I think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design.  Nothing is removable so I don't think we'll be needing to replace any parts.  I would buy another one if I needed one.
I wasn't expecting too much from the price but I definitely got my money's worth. I had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet. It also has dried my hair faster, even on the low heat setting. Love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier. Great purchase and would recommend it to a friend.
Works great and dries my hair really fast! I have long, medium-thickness hair and this does the trick. Love the different heat settings and how it doesn't just have a cool button, but an actual cool setting. Only thing is I wish this came with a diffuse attachment...
This simple, inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel.<br />It did precisely what it was supposed to, despite some of the<br />troublesome negative reviews.  It stuck fast to several mirrors<br />over the course of my trip and enabled me to style my hair<br />easily.  I used a fairly lightweight travel-sized blower (Baby Liss)<br />which it supported with ease.
perfecto
I really love everything about this hair dryer.  It is fast, has lots of settings, and black with PINK TRIM.  It is a little heavy, but it works so well I don't care.  I am thinking my old, cheaper hairdryers were too light and could not get the job done.  This cost a little more, but I am totally happy with it.  Get one!
This dryer was affordable and has held up very well. I use the flow narrowing attachment and even with daily use, I notice my hair is much smoother and shiner, and has less damage, than every before. I've been using this dryer for over a year without a problem and really love it.<br /><br />Edited to add: I have now been using this dryer for two years and it works just as well as when I first bought it. I would buy again if I needed to replace it.
I also started using this as my main hair dryer.
powerful and small enough to travel with
it works great, love it and recommend to use and have at home
In with the new, out with the old! At first, when it didn't roar like my old one I thought I had bought a dud, but then it worked faster, with less heat, and less air. I love it. I only wish it had a retractable cord.
This is a great little hair dryer.  It is the third one I have purchased.  I use it at home as my regular hair dryer due to the light weight yet great power.  I gave one to a family member for their guest bathroom and recently gave one to a friend for her guest bathroom.<br /><br />It is compact and  sturdy, light in weight yet powerful at 1600 watts.  It has a low and a high setting.  It is a very good size to pack for travel, and even has dual voltage.<br /><br />I really like this little hair dryer and recommend it.
My wife loves this blowdryer!!
love this dryer
Perfect for travel and everyday use.
My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift. She said it is the best blow dryer she has used and people often ask where did she get them.
The best for my family.
Best hair dryer I have had!!

Best christmas gift ever!!!  Strong power and can blow hair in 1/2 the time!  Absolutely love it!!!
make my hair style look good all day
Good product!
Excelent
Just what I wanted.  Small, but powerfull.
I am pleasantly surprised by my effortless shopping experience.  I was a bit leery after reading a few reviews where customers had a hard time contacting the seller or getting satisfaction after receiving defective items but I took a leap of faith since the complaints were few and ordered my dryer.  It came four days early!  Although it came in two separate boxes, installation was a snap even with the minimal directions that were included.  There is a slight burning smell when the dryer is first turned on, but like most new electrical appliances, it soon fades away.  This dryer gets very hot which I love.  I had to lower the thermostat after a few minutes.  The actual hood is larger than I expected and I did worry that it would be top heavy but so far I haven't had any problems.  My sister, who has locs, was impressed.  This dryer completely dried her hair in about 30 minutes and she usually has to sit for more than an hour to ensure that her hair is thoroughly dry.
Really handy to use. And the pink color makes my day ;)
I had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and I've been looking for a replacement to love as much as I loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service. This is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air. I don't like a dryer that gets too hot, and I was pleased that even the high setting doesn't get so hot that I feel like it's trying to bake my hair rather than dry it. The low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying. It has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good-sized grip. My hair is prone to static and this unit doesn't induce that unpleasant state. I had high expectations for the Andis RC-2 Ionic1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord and it didn't disappoint me.
Cheap, but powerful enough to get the job done! It is smaller than a regular-sized hair dryer that most people use at home, but it is larger than those super-compact travel hair dryers. However, I will be using this on my travels instead of those compact ones because of its power and multiple settings.
I liked it so much ... The size is small and very good materials .. I strongly advice any one who is looking for hair dryer to buy it Five stars ØŒ...
Compact and powerful
Works great. We actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home. Very happy...and the price is great!
VERY GOOD
ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ONE. EASY TO CARRY ON VACATION OR JUST FOR AN OVERNIGHT VISIT. WORKS GREAT :)
This is exactly what I wanted.  It is kind to my thinning hair (I'm 65+) and easy to handle.  I love the retractable cord.
This hair dryer has got great power!<br />It takes me less time to blow out my hair now. Love it!
Excellent Hair Dryer! The stores do not carry a compact folding retractable dryer like this one!
This hairdryer is great for the price, very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!!
good .
Pro quality hair dryer.  Same model as used by wife's hair stylist.
Very good
This thing is seriously tiny! So tiny but boy does it pack a punch. Hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer. I am so happy with this hairdryer I'd recommend it to anyone.
Excellent product!
Excellent product
Working perfect.
I guess I should say &#34;Mom loves it&#34;.  Met her needs perfectly.
This is a must have!!! Can't thank you enough!
Great.  Basic hair dryer but it does a great job and has all the connectors. Worth the buy
Purchased to replace an older model that finally died.  This is a great little unit and much nicer than it's predecessor.
First purcahse with the seller, delivery to Canada is about 2.5 weeks, and product is vry good, worse for the dollar spend.
I bought this to replace the exact same one I had purchased 15 years ago. The old one just stopped working on the high setting, but still works on low. Very handy, nice design with the night light feature, keeps the hair dryer out of the way. I was happy to find the exact same item - I got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one, so I can't complain.
This is a very nice compact (foldable) hand held dryer.  There are two heat settings and the power is just perfect for my application which is simply to have an on hand portable dryer to dry clothes when I travel.  I occasionally need to hand wash a few clothing items in hotels when out on the road and this is perfect for this mission.
This is durable, gets very hot and has a great design.
I love my hair dryer and the delivery was as stated (time frame).
Works great! So much more power and heat than my old blow dryer.  Not heavy at all, average weight probably.  I love it!!!
This is a much better hair dryer that I have ever used.  It is light, and has several options to use.  Love the retractable cord.  Stores easily!
Awesome product, very user friendly and compact for traveling. My wife loves it!
everything I wanted. I mounted it in my motorhome and I love that I can remove it to take with me if I'm using a public shower. Just what I was looking for.
My hair stylist recently showed me how to get my wavy hair to be a bit more curly by finger-styling my hair and then sitting under a hood dryer.  I purchased this hair dryer and it worked faster and better than the salon dryer!  I sit under it for about 4 minutes and my hair is dry enough to hold whatever style I give it.  I have a lot of hair so having it dry this quickly is terrific.  How nice it will be to have dry hair every morning this winter!<br /><br />The service was fast and the packaging was appropriate.  A totally positive experience.
Bought this for my wife and she LOVES it.  She says it works better than any other hair dryer she has ever owned.  My wife is happy, so I am happy.
I bought this hair dryer as spare. You don't know when the old one will stop working. I didn't use it yet but I hope it will be good because I had good experience with Remington products.
Love it - Love it!
Great hair dryer. good weight. I have coarse wavy hair that takes a long time to dry. This hair dryer does a better than average job of drying my hair quickly
I love this hair dryer! Dries my hair fast!
Love this blow dyer
I needed a new hairdryer.  The report on this one was very accurate.  It does a great job, is easy to use and dependable.  I can also take it to shows and vacations
It works perfectly and I can take it everywhere in little space.
Love this bonnet dryer, so convenient and easy storage!
very good~
Great dryer... Easy to assemble, heats up quick, heat is adjustable, mobile, works like a charm... No complaints!
The hair dryer is great and does the job just fine.  It is lightweight and travels well.
LOVE THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DRAG THE BLOW DRYER OUT EVERY MORNING.  ITS THERE AND READY WHEN I NEED IT.
This has cut my drying time in half! It's a bit heavier than I was expecting but still exceeded expectations.
Greatest tool for natural chicks
Great for travel, although a tad heavy, but works like a full size dryer.  I like the retractable cord, but it does take a bit of getting used to.  If you pull away when you are drying your hair, it will partly retract, but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with.  No big deal.  I am very impressed with this dryer.
Fast, smooth and easy!  The wall mount saves time in the daily routine of drying hair.  I should buy one for each bathroom!
Very good, light weight and efficient. Loved the price and product!!!
Vender delivered by promised date and dryer works great. I would recommend.
This was a replacement, I had the same one since at least 2005. It is very light weight with lots of power. Easy to use to style with.
The dryer was easy to assemble. Gets hot very quickly, and the cord is long enough for me to move around with ease. Sometimes it does feel a little bit top heavy, but overall it's a great dryer!
Extremely happy with my purchase, great product and shipping was fast :)
Best Pro Dryer ever! Super long cord makes it #1
Very quiet as advertised, a huge improvement over the last one my wife had that certainly was bad for her hearing.  Also produces good air speed and heat, both of which my wife was nervous about ahead of time.
Really love this.  I used in a hotel and seen that it was really handy.  Got one for my spare bath.  So when I have company they no longer have to pack as much stuff.  Trying to give company that hotel guess feel.  Very nice that it includes a night lite.  No longer having to turn on the big light, blinding yourself at night.  I would for sure recommend.
Perfect for the price.  An ionic dryer should not cost $200.00
bien
I've used this style of dryer for decades, and this is my favorite model ever! It gets the job done quickly and efficiently, and it is kinder to my hair. To top it off, it is the most reasonably priced dryer I've bought in many years. I bought an extra one, just in case!
Good
This hair dryer works fine.  I bought it for a trip to Europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers so I didn't need it after all.  But I'm glad I have it for when I go to Europe again and there isn't a hair dryer available.  It's very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely.
I purchased this Conair Hair Dryer several months ago. I have been very pleased with my purchase. My previous hair dryer was also a Conair and I had used it for several years. There are a few improvements on the new dryer that the old one didn't have, and I am very happy to have them because they were things I didn't like about the old dryer. This dryer has a &#34;Cool&#34; button, a feature I haven't had before and I wasn't sure if I even needed it. It does come in handy when finishing styling, holding your style in place.There are two attachments; a flow director and a defuser. These attachments easily snap into place and are easy to remove, unlike the old attachments which were a struggle to get on and off. This dryer fulfills all my needs. Thanks for the improvements Conair. The dryer shipped quickly and was in good shape when delivered. Fulfilled as promised by Amazon.
work as what it was intended to do. Drys hair!
It works great! Enjoy the retractable cord.
This is a great value for the price.  It does the trick.  I don't need anything fancy.  It is simple.  I just wanted something to dry my hair.
I bought this several years ago but I still use it.  This is a quiet, well made blow dryer that works very well.  It's expensive; but it's worth it.
very well constructed hair dryer.. it's one of the heavy duty built that you can get for little price...
Best little travel dryer with plenty of power......love it, love it !!!!! Conair rules !!!
Very good vendor to deal with......very good product.
I have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling. It holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer. Not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer. excellent product. Quick delivery
Great little travel hair dryer! Very powerful for a little hair dyer
Very heavy but powerful, it leaves my hair shiny.
Quieter than most!  Dries quickly. The cord storage is great but does have issues once in awhile.  Never had one that didn't.
My wife love it!
It is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12!
Great hair dryer at a great price.
buenisimo
Very good for my granddaughter's thick,course,and natural  hair without putting a perm in it.
Great no frills hair dryer.
Perfect replacement for my old, burnt out hair dryer.
I love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling. It is small and packs easily. The wattage is easily changed for travel abroad. It actually had two speeds when I used it in Europe. Often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not. I was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad. I would highly recommend it for foreign travel.
This hands free hair dryer is so useful i ordered 2 more for my sisters. Its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time. I am grateful this was invented it makes life so easy:)
The first one I received was DOA.  No biggie - Amazon had a replacement at my doorstep in a few days!  Small and works well (like most other reviews state).  I'm probably going to order another one at this price just to keep for a back up!
This dryer is literally the best hair dryer i have ever used. I watched youtube videos on the product before i purchased it and no one had anything bad to say about the item. I would highly recommend that anyone use this dryer you will find that it is well worth the price.
I've NEVER styled my hair with a blow dryer. I always just dry & then flat iron, for many reasons. Mainly I'm not coordinated enough to use a round brush & hold a blow dryer. In my 20s I bought the round brush blow dryer. You know the all in one, lol & it worked okay but my hair was still frizzy. This blow dryer is AMAZING! Even with me fighting the round brush in one hand & the dryer in the other, my hair is smooth & shiny. Just like when I leave the salon! Don't pass on this one ladies, worth every penny! I did notice a weird smell, I'm hoping it was just the dryer components heating up for the first time.
Love it Love it Love.  I almost dropped $200 bucks on a blow dryer from the Dry Bar, but opted to save some $ instead when my hair dresser told me about this one.  I love the temp functions and it really does the job without totally damaging my hair!  Also, I seem to be able to blow dry my hair faster since the end of the blow dryer is smaller and air is really more concentrated.
Great! Quiet! Love it! Bought 2 immediately!<br /><br />Kelly in San Antonio, TX
Best hair dryer I have ever, every had, at my age I have had several!<br />My hairdresser said this is one of the closest to &#34;professional&#34; hair dryers,<br />and it is the truth!  Great, great heat and quick drying.
Excellent quality and ergonomics. Love the green light. Good temperature and air flow. Installed 2 of them. Easy to install with wall mollys from local Walmart as the ones that came with the unit were not suitable.
Excelente
I love this hairdryer. At home, I use a CHI that I have had for about ten years. It still works perfectly but it is a beast. I was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym so I started looking for a compact model and this really fits the bill at a great price. Keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey CHI and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle.
good for the price. came back for the second one.
It's a hairdryer =-)  Makes less noise than some. Works well and is recommended.
Love it as a home use dryer.  Not compact enough to qualify as a travel dryer in my book but it's the best dryer I've ever owned.  I have LOTS of thick, course, wavy hair and this appliance dries it in half the time (or less) than all of my previous ones without excessive heat.  Love the cold shot. It really is cold.  Get this dryer.  You will not be disappointed!
Great little dryer. I bought 2 to keep at relatives'  houses for when guests  (like me) visit them.  I have  visited and used both dryers.
I love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use
My Daughter loves it
Excellent, loved it
Love it.
No problems or criticisms whatsoever.<br />But I'm a guy, so my standards may be lower. :-)<br /><br />Not as strong-forced a &#34;wind&#34; as my previous 20-year-old blow dryer generated, but it still dries my thinning hair rapidly, and is not as noisy as my old dryer.  It feels solid (not cheap) to handle, and has a nice gold color in person.  It's good that there are three comb/brush attachments, as I know they tend to break over the years.<br /><br />--Happy customer
This blow dryer is perfect! Recommended to me by my hair stylist after she used it on my hair, and I immediately purchased right after my hair appointment! Dries my hair fast, allows you to change the speed and temperature, and also features a &#34;cool shot&#34; button! Plus it comes with the awesome add on to attach to the end and direct air flow! Came fast and exactly as described! Plus the pink is super cute, it is a lighter pink than pictured than...but you won't be disappointed! :)
GOOD
These do a good job of drying my wife's hair, and she happy with the product.
I always buy Conair Hair Dryers!  This one is lightweight...I like the different settings of the dryer..for me it works great...I have very short hair and it is fine, but you would think my hair was thicker because of this dryer and the small round brush I use.  Extremely happy with this purchase!
Great hair dryer!!!! Am so glad I purchased it :)
good value
I had one of these for ... 7? 8? years and it finally died. As in sparks flew out of it!! I ordered a newer version of the same dryer. Very pleased with it. Saw no reason to change.
Great price, sturdy, dries my thick shoulder-length hair quickly.  Not a quiet device, but well worth it.  Hair feels smooth and shiny, not weighted down.
Nice little blowdryer.  We bought two, one for each bathroom.  They get really hot on low setting.
Wow, this works really well for the price. It gets rid of frizz and is really quiet if used on the low setting (which I use). I have curly and EXTREMELY frizzy hair, and this helped it get smoother while also giving it volume that I love. Also, the price is pretty fantastic for what it does.
Works great
Great product! Great seller
excellent
Works great.
Use it to dry my dog.
Love it. It's more comfortable that the one one I previously had. Easy to use. At least I can lay down.
This was an inexpensive hair dryer and I was skeptical about it at first.  It didn't seem to put out as much power as my last dryer which shorted out and blew a house fuse.  However, it seems to dry just as quickly and is not as noisy as my last dryer.  It's easy to handle and not too heavy.  I have been happy with this product.
Good product.
Love it! Dries my hair quickly. Has lots of settings. The cord doesn't is long and doesn't tangle. Easy to clean the back screen. And I Love the cold shot button. Yeah and I love that it's Red...Pretty:) AWESOME Dryer.
Great product that i have searched for many years....good power & dual voltage
I bought it 10 month ago. Its quality can be trusted.
dry hair very fast! I love it!
I had to find this model on Amazon because my local Targets weren't selling this model anymore. My puppy chewed up my first one, and bought another type at Target, but it was SO loud, and I took it back. I'm happy that I found this for sale on Amazon because it's quiet-as far as blow dryers go- and I love the retractable cord. As long as they make this particular model, that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one.
Always go for the Hot Tools as the professionals use this product and they last a long time.
Good bang for the buck.  Works fine.
Very powerful Hair Dryer.<br /><br />The Warm setting is almost hot, while the Hot setting is nice and toasty :)<br />The cool shot immediately takes effect. That's nice.<br /><br />It came with a couple of accessories to attach to the front, but haven't been able to try them out.<br /><br />Construction seems solid. The wire was thick and insulated.<br /><br />Can't beat it for a $10 dryer.
Works perfect and cant beat the price!
I bought this for my sister, to replace her ancient conair hair dryer. She has super thick long hair and the old one did her well for years and years, so when it finally died, it only seemed natural to ty and find one by the same brand. Well, she loves this thing, it is super light and powerful. The diffuser makes all the difference in the world. Don't be afraid to buy this, you will be happy
This item works well, seems sturdy, is attractive, and was priced right.  Hopefully, it will last!
This small compact dryer is so perfect for my wash and go hair do and does just what I want it to do to my hair.  I really love it and get my hair done in less than five minutes. I'm sure the cut has a lot to do with it as well, so they go hand in hand.
I needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Light weight, powerful and easy to use.
Like being able to hang the dryer on wall or cabinet so it is easy to use. Does not take up space on counter or in drawer.
This is a great dryer!  I have been using it almost daily for a little over a year now and it is still like new.  It is easy to clean the intake screen and the cord and housing still look like new!  I have dropped this dryer several times with no problems what so every.  A great dryer for the whole family.
Arrived quickly and works great.
I got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me, so I bought this hair dryer in February 2009 - over 5 years ago.  I use it every day and it's still working great.<br /><br />The switches for off/low/high and low/medium/high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer, and yet luckily I don't accidentally hit the switches when I'm holding it.<br /><br />This isn't lightweight and it takes up room when traveling, but I still insist on bringing this with me on trips.  Very happy I spent the extra money for it because it's saved me money - I don't have to replace a burned out hair dryer every year.
Used this hair dryer in an expensive hotel and had to buy one for home. Love retractable cord. Good power. Fits nicely in drawer since it folds.
Such a good sized hair dryer for the price. This is not a mini, it is a full size hair dryer. has warm and hot setting, basic and durable.
I travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage. It's powerful and drys my hair quickly without &#34;frying&#34; it. I've tried more expensive models (both Andis models and other manufacturers) but I keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others.
I really like this dryer!  Only had it a few weeks but so far it works great!  It arrives set for a lower wattage to save energy and I did not even bother to change it.  It drys quickly and as dryers go, quietly.  The night light is still burning bright.  Some have complained too bright and that they would like a switch to turn off the light.  You can always unplug it.  If I was looking for faults I think they might look at how the hand held blower fits the wall bracket.  It is somewhat of a tightfit.  An occasional dab of soap on the base of the handle eases the snap in and out.  This is a great improvement over the last brand we had.
Excellent hairdryer for travel.  Folding handle makes packing much easier as does the retractable cord.  Very good hair dryer.
Great dryer and seller
Wonderful dryer. Really gets my hair dry quickly. I liked it so much that I bought another one for my daughter.
What a great blow dryer for an even better price! This was recommended to my by my stylist and I'm so glad I didn't spend the big bucks on a salon brand dryer. This dryer makes such a huge difference in my hair compared to the Revlon I used to use. My hair takes half the time to dry and looks shiny and smooth when finished, just like it looks when leaving the salon. A great blow dryer really does make all the difference. Save your money and get this one, you won't regret it!
It dries hairs fast and with a silky look!<br /><br />Takes less time to get wonderful results and it's low noise.<br /><br />I recomend it
Used this product at a Courtyard Marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer.  I have thick hair. It usually took me a long time to dry my hair with my old dryer which was heavy, plus the cord got tangled, and the high heat, which I need, often got too hot.  This Ion hair dryer had NONE of those issues; so when I returned home I looked it up on the internet and was delighted to find it reasonably priced and bought it.  I've been using it for 2 months now and love it.
I only use conair blow dryers. This one is smaller than my last one (which was 5+ years old). The barrel is shorter making it easier to pack for a trip.<br /><br />ML
This hairdryer is pretty, smooth, and makes my hair incredibly shiny, soft, smooth and frizz free. It dries my hair quicker than other hairdryers and is quieter too. Love it!
Purchased this for a trip to Italy where suitcase space was such a premium.  It performed just like a full size model and I absolutely LOVE it!
I ordered this when the cord on the same exact one I had became damaged. I had it for about 5 years and didn't want to experiment with other models or brands. Old reliable wins for me!
I haven't used it yet so I can't say much.  I'm waiting till we move and I'll use it in the new house.
This little blow dryer is amazing! It's very light weight but powerful. I was needing a blow dryer that wasn't so heavy and this dryer is the one for the job. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a lightweight dryer that does a great job as well!
It is soooo light, it's more powerful than expected! I have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting. This is my 1st tourmaline ceramic hair dryer and I'm very impressed. I plan to replace my daily dryer with this one or maybe another tourmaline ceramic one because it has definitely improved the smoothness of my hair. Also comes with black/white storage bag which is kinda nice. It does not fold, which I knew when I purchased it but it's not necessary feature since it's so small! Highly recommend!
This is exactly what I was looking for!  I stayed in a hotel in NYC and this is the hair dryer they had in the bathroom. It was so good that I wrote down the model so I could order it when I got home.  It dries well, folds up perfectly to fit in my cabinet, and the cord even pulls in so I can easily store it or pack it.
Like the compact feature.  Love the strength in blowing power. Great for travel with dual wattage.<br /><br />Would purchase again.<br /><br />It's a keeper!
If you happen to be looking for a no-frills nice performing basic hair dryer this is precisely that--it offers no bells and whistles but for the price no one should expect such. My deciding variable in a hair dryer is does it blow-dry with power or is it somewhat lacking in this area (I've had my share of the low power models and I am quite picky here). Verdict: it's plenty powerful and allows for a quick exit out the door every morning.<br /><br />***Update*** As of today 10-21-16 I officially lay to rest this device. Honestly, It has been used 24/7/365 for just about 2.5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product (at the time I paid $11). I am by no means an expert in this area but I assume it's not common to get much more than several years at best for a hair-dryer subject to daily use.
I got this for my gf and she loves using it. She used to hate taking showers at night just because of the wet hair but this thing changed her life :)
It's true, if you wait, the best will come to you. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. My hair dries in a matter of seconds, no kidding ! However the retractable cord feature &#34; does not work &#34;. But that's ok !  It is foldable. And I am glad I purchased the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875 Ceramic Hair Dryer.
I love this product!  I bought it because the cord is retractable which eliminates winding around the handle or a big tangle when storing.  The biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer & then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair.  Love, Love, Love it!!!
I don't style my hair with a dryer, I just blow it for volume, then use the curling iron if I'm in the mood.  My previous one was dying, and I've found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy, with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling.  They take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry.  This is that same model as my last one, only with half-again more power. And it's very compact and lightweight, with a large nozzle for lots of airflow.  It's also quieter than most the big ones I've tried and given away.  Love it, love it, love it.
Great price, great blow dryer! I travel a lot and always need a small but powerful one. I end up leaving mine behind when I go to places such as Cuba where they can't get any, and I simply replace it when I get home.
I love this device!  The power is amazing.  My hair is dry in minutes.  It feels really nice in your hands too.
Although compact it delivers!  My hair dries pretty quickly.  It does a great job.  I use this one more than my regular size expensive dryer.
This is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size.  For years I have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country & Caribbean.  I have really long, thick hair & always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took FOREVER to dry my hair. This one worked like a charm time & time again.<br /><br />Finally, I looked it up & couldn't believe how inexpensive it was. I ordered 1 for my house & 2 for my beach house. Had them almost 2 years now & they still work great!!<br /><br />My only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won't retract sometimes, but the dryer is still powerful & works like a charm!
Great little dryer, especially for the price.  We boondock in our motorhome all the time and don't always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair.  This little unit has much better deying power than I expected.  Very happy camper!
WAS CHEEP AND EXCELLENT HOME DRYER, LADIES CAN USE IT WITHOUT BURNING THEIR HAIR.I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO BE USED AT HOME FOR EVERY BODY IN THE FAMILY.
Used it in southern France. Directions very clear about how to switch the voltage. Still needs the plug adapter, but I knew that when I bought it. Folds up nicely, Very powerful for such a small dryer.
Very light and drys fast! Really quit and happy I bought this T3 hair dryer you will be happy to !!
I LOVE THIS DRYER, BECAUSE HAS SEVERAL DRYING SETTING, COOL, WARM, OR HOT, HIGH , LOW, NEGATIVE ION, NETURAL ION,  My husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair.
I love this hair dryer. My friend had it and I liked it so much that I bought one for myself. It comes with the two attachments and the different heat settings are great if you need to dry your hair quickly or if you are taking your time to style.
Light weight and dries hair fast!  Super-quiet as advertised.  Highly recommend! This is a great product at a great price!
I love this hair dryer! It's super quiet and doesn't get too hot on the Medium setting as with many other hair dryers. I highly recommend this one.
My wife loves it, much easier to handle than her old 1850 Watt hair dryer, and doesn't pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps.
If I knew this Hair Dryer was this good. (more than just good), I wouldn't spend to buy many Hair Dryers in the past. This one is very quiet and powerful. The dryer is still cool after use it. Buy one. You won't regret.
I love this hair dryer. It is quiet, but powerful. I used it to replace a Remington hair dryer that only lasted me a couple years. I'm hoping this one last much longer
I was looking for a lightweight, powerful hairdryer, and this fits the bill.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend it.
I love this as it never gets too hot and of course it's fairly portable.  I can do things in the kitchen as I dry my hair.  It's nice that it has a brush attachment as well, like that a lot.
The cord is a little short - but this machine is strong sturdy and well built.  So far so good.  I'm happy w/the purchase.
I was looking to replace my hair dryer but didn't want to spend over a hundred dollars for it.  I checked with Amazon and the Onei MK-II hair dryer was featured for less than half that price.  I figured if it wasn't that good I would keep it as a back up.  I am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer. It works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers. My hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster.  I use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house.  Another good quality is that for a full-size hair dryer, it is lighter than most.
This blow dryer does not dry out my hair...while a little loud...I have soft hair after using this dryer everytime
I looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings (low, med, high) AND 3 actual fan speeds (low, med, high). It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

Read the other positive reviews and decided to purchase this model.<br />Have not been disappointed.<br />Works as promised and although no hair dryer is truly &#34;quiet&#34;, this one comes close.<br />Highly recommend!
This is a very simple but great blower.  We are using it daily and are happy with it.  Good product.
great for traveling. have a little trouble getting cord to retract but I haven't used it much, so should loosen up as I use it.
This dryer is great.  It compares with a $100+ dryer for a fraction of the cost.  I was so excited to find this on Amazon, as it's so much cheaper than at Ulta.  Really, really great device, and the attachments only add to that.
This is the BEST blow dryer I have ever used.  It is extremely light weight and my thick hair is blow dried very quickly without my arm getting tired and sore.  My hair looks amazing too, shiny ans smooth.  In the past, I often didn't dry all the way because it took too long, but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast.  I love this hair dryer.  Definately worth the money.
Size and weight are what I had hoped for when purchasing this dryer for my upcoming trip overseas! Can't wait
After years with my old hairdryer, I found that the new, cheaper ones were just that, cheap.  This is great hairdryer.  It actually makes my hair look better -- gives my short hair more body.  It is very quiet -- my dogs don't run out of the bathroom!  Works great and feels like it should last...
Love the hairdryer!  Just what I was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer!
The item arrived perfectly on time and in great condition. It has an adequate blowing system and heating for my medium texture of hair.
I Love this blow dryer its like one of the coolest things ive ever seen i got tired of the wires from a blow dryer being all on the floor and ground and this product eliminates that problem its pretty strong too.
I have very thick, frizzy, and what you could call &#34;confused&#34; hair (not wavy or curly or straight). I have straightened my hair with a blow dryer since I was 13 years old. Needless to say, I have been through A LOT of blow dryers. This is the best one I have ever had. I'm on my second and about to buy my third (for backup). It does get pretty hot, but I alternate with the low and high setting depending on which part of my hair I'm doing and how much is in the piece. I HIGHLY recommend this blow dryer if you have thick, unruly hair as myself, it's a BEAST. What used to take me hours now takes me 30-40 minutes tops. Very happy.
I had a really old Conair that I liked but it was quite shabby, so replaced it with what I knew should be a good hairdryer. The different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl
I am a Fan of T3 items for years, This dryer seems to dry my hair very fast, leaving it shiny
I first used this hair dryer in a hotel after that I had to have one. I found it on Amazon, made the purchase and I am very pleased with my purchase.
I wasted so much money on a few hair dryers, I wish I would have ordered this one first, its a really great hair dryer
I stayed at a Lowe's hotel in LA last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it.  I liked it's compact, lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that I keep on all the time.  I find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the $19 I paid for it.
Works great, not heavy on the hands to use and it doesn't fry my hair . I have baby thin fly away wavy hair and this blower keeps it in control with minimal heat . Definitely recommend! As usual Amazon delivers on time or before time.
Wanted same brand and wattage they have on the wall at our Y.<br />Perfect.  Just what my spouse was looking for.
I purchased this because I travel abroad quite a bit and needed a reliable hair dryer. I took this and all of my friends took theirs. Mine was the only one left standing. The dual wattage allows me to use this in America and also when I go places. I am very pleased with this product.
Product arrived on schedule.  Have looked for several years for a decent, reasonably<br />priced hairdryer which is lightweight with several heat settings, and not too loud!<br />The decibel level was always the deal breaker.  Not with this Revlon hairdryer.  Very<br />pleased!!
This is a great, lightweight hair dryer. I have very thick Hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely.
I tried this hair dryer in a very upscale marriott hotel and was so impressed I came home and purchased. Lightweight and powerful.
Great hair dryer. Drys my hair quickly with less frizzy/dried out hair. Would definiitely recommend this hair dryer to all
This is a great hair dryer and a great deal, the price is definitely a steal for a very nice, good working dryer
This is the third time I have bought this model. I love that it mounts on the wall so I don't have it in a drawer or on the counter. The night light is a bonus. Each one lasts about 5 years before the plastic breaks or wears out.
So, I like quiet, powerful hairdriers. My last one broke, and I ordered this one. It does what it needs to.
This thing is amazing. I was tired of using the crappy cheap one my mom bought for me and my sisters. This thing i hav seen all over youtube and can't get enough of it!
It works well and mounts easily the night light is mounted in the handle and give just the right amount of light
This dryer works great, not too heavy. Dries well. You could do worse for twice the price (and I have.)
I am so happy this hair dryer is light, well-functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel. Highly recommend this product!
Traveling a lot for work, this is great for on-the-go compact and powerful hair-drying products. Comes with cute bag and diffuser. Love it!
I have owned an Andis mini-dryer before and was very pleased.  So far this little dryer works great, too.  I'm happy to recommend it to others.
Great dryer and best for styling.....the heat is perfect and had it on time and a great product...love to have it
Perfect. Great price, great size. It was a gift and she loved it so much. 100% recomended. The only thing was that the box was too big for it.
My wife and daughter love this. Best blow dryer ever. Worth the money. Hair feels nice and soft after using this.
Love this hair dryer. Used this model for about 8 years. Yes the give out like all hair dryers and I have to buy a new one, but quality is always the same when I have to get a new one. Very powerful and dries hair quickley!
This is so much more convenient than dragging a dryer from a drawer or cabinet.  Hotels have had the right idea all along.
This is the best dryer EVER!  I would never owe any other brand.  Drys my very thick curly head of hair in less than 10 mins.
I love this dryer, its easy on your hair and it came with attachments.. It also arrived quickly and in perfect shape.
It is the best  Hair Dryer I have ever used !<br />And it is working very good , and it is the best for it's price .<br />Thank you !
This one replaced one which disappeared when my daughter went home.  It should last until it disappears like the last one.
This is my third 1875 Watt Hard Hat Hair dryer by Conair Pro Style.  They are well worth the money and last!  I bought this one so it could be sent to my summer vacation rental.
I took this on my vacation and it worked wonderfully, so I purchased another. The bag will hold more than just the dryer, I threw in combs and a few other small items. I will be buying a third as a gift.
So far I love this hairdryer! I've only had it for a few months, but it replaced my old Conair hairdryer that I had for over 10 years. It's fairly quiet, which is kind-of a big deal, and it works really quickly. Plus, its like this soft matte finish, and it doesn't slip out of my hands. I'm hoping it lasts as long as my last hairdryer!
Its been a week I received this hair dryer and so far I am satisfied with its performance. It is very light and small, infact smaller than a fold-able hair dryer. Perfect for traveling. It heats up instantly and dries hair faster. I intend to use it outside the country and hoping it will keep up in its performance.<br />However, I think changing the voltage is not easy. have to figure it out.<br />One of the reason I am giving it 5 star is for Amazon's service. The price of this item reduced by $5 since the time I purchased it. I happened to notice it and called Amazon. they swiftly refunded my money. Couldn't be happier.
This dries my hair extremely fast and it has incredibly affordable. I am extremely glad I bought this product. It also comes with attachments that are handy.
I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn't have a cold shot but I don't need one.  It also doesn't have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female's hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!<br /><br />Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don't have curly hair, so I don't' use it.
This dryer was more than I expected.  I had an old 1875.  It dries my hair so quickly and the settings are great.
Excellent. Very high volume of air. Good heat control. Easy to hold.  Seems to be very high quality  blow dryer.
What you see is what you get. I've been wanting one for a very long time. I am very satisfied with my new hair dyer.
I used to hate drying my hair... I have thick long hair, it took forever.  I am also pretty frugal.  So when my cheap old hair drying stopped working, I bought this. What a difference! My hair dries faster! yeah!
Bought this because I loved the hidden real away cord.  Works great and puts out LOTS of air.  Drys hair fast. Love it.
This is a great hair dryer! It is a little heavy but it works so well, who cares. It has great temperature settings and dries hair fast!
It's everything the other 4-5 star reviewers said. My favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord.  And of course Amazons service is one of the best!!! Love Amazon!!    Update;  8 months after purchasing this dryer, I pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out! I was unable to send it back to Amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty! I did and Onei Beauty made it simple! I send it back to them and they'll send me another! Voila! Done! I'm not sure how long this product will last, but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame! Because after all I REALLY LOVE THIS DRYER!!
Teenage daughter &#34;had to have&#34; one of these. Reluctantly, I bought. Been a superb product without issues since purchase and she uses literally daily. Would buy again, but hope I don't have too! Smiles...
I use to buy the department store regular hair dryers and my hair was never as smooth as I want, I had to flat iron a lot. This dryer is amazing. Takes all the work out of blow drying. You can see the steam of water as you dry. Be careful it is high heat, but will dry your hair in half the time and you need very little flat ironing.
I am still using this machine. It really is a great blow dryer. It dries your hair quickly. It is worth the purchase.
I love it!! I have never had a blow dryer that was as quiet as this one! Love the pieces that come with it.
This is my second purchase of this daily use dryer.  The first one lasted about 10 years.  I was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market. This one is so great because it has lots of power AND the blower settings(low and high) are separate from the heat settings(cool, warm, and hot).I use the hotel provided dryers when I travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever.
I love this little hair dryer from Andis.  I have had one for years and it works great, does not take up much room in my suit case when I travel and does not cost much.  I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.
I first tried this at a Marriott and loved the hidden cord.  I'm tired of multiple cords on my counter.  The speed is great as is the power.  It dries my hair faster that my old drier.
It's dries your hair quickly and it's not too loud.  This is the second one that I've bought.  The first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires but the motor never wore out.  Great product!
This dryer does it job, and I used it for tasks beyond its description. It works great and still functioning.
Best price I have seen, plus great quality! Super quiet, not a giant long annoying cord, not too short of a cord either, love love love the diffuser attachment since I have curly hair, attachments stay on really well, low and warm does a great job on my thin and super curly hair.
We ended up buying two of these. One for each bathroom. Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way. Like the ones in nice hotels it has it's own GFCI protector so it can be installed by the sink. Save a drawer in the vanity, or get the counter cleaned off.
I'm not one to buy expensive haircare products but after a stay at a hotel, I fell in love with the blow dryer in the rooms.  I wrote down the brand and model and set out to find one when I got home.  Amazon was the only place that was still selling this model.  I almost bought 2 in case they go out of production but I guess I'll just use this one and hope it lasts forever, lol.
Perfect hairdryer! I'm glad I found this on Amazon for an amazing price. I plan on buying a few for Gifts to give out.
This blow dryer packs a lot of power.  Small, convenient and easy to use.  The wall mount keeps it nicely tucked away between uses.  It is exactly like the ones you find in hotels which is what I was looking for.
works perfectly great quality. I trust this brand, so didn't hesitate when buying it and was not disapointed. I reccommend.
I love this hair dryer! I've had it about 2 months so far. It's main benefit is it dries my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. I also seem to have less frizzies. It is a little heavy, but I got used to that really quickly. Several different heat and intensity settings also, which I like alot. It's not too loud either.
bought this for my condo which we rent out and have always been happy with conair.  I like the night light because I always had a night light in the bathroom and now this serves 2 purposes.
Works great and is light to handle for a medium size hair dryer.  Also very easy to travel with and pack.
Bought two of  these...and the best item ever. works nicely...fit on wall great and easy to install...Buying one more for my Dad .
This is the nicest blow dryer I have ever had and it's very reasonably priced. I am really happy with it.
I have been using this for for a few weeks and am impressed.  It replaced a 10 year old dryer and has made a difference in my morning routine.  It seems a bit heavier than my old one but the speed of drying is worth it.
After receiving a Conair cordkeeper for Christmas and only using it about 8 times, it died. Lucky I was able to get my money back at Walmart. So I decided to read lots of Amazon reviews on hairdryers in the $20-$30 price range and chose this one.<br />I loved it the first time I used it! It's a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.<br />After my Conair experience, I don't have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser. However, I think I will use it everyday, as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use!
I've had Andis hair dryers before and they've always served their purpose well. I particularly like this one because it has an off switch. It is a tad heavier than another Andis I had. The night light does not bother me in fact it really is a great night light, although the green needs a bit of getting used to. Great hair dryer
Its a great hairdryer, it blows hot air, at 3 speeds with a cold air setting. I can't imagine what else a hair dryer needs to do? and at $10 amazing value ;)
I recommend this hair dryer because it works well and is easy to install in your bathroom.  The price is right too.
The lady who received it, loved it. She had selected it from all the similar products advertized. It continues to serve her well.
I have used this model for many years. When one wares out I buy another. It does not last supper long, but works well for me at a very reasonable price. From experience, it works as well as anything else in this style and price range. I hope they never stop making this model.
My only regret is that I didn't find what is essentially the same hair dryer - also available from Amazon - without the wasted (and unneeded) plastic frame (housing... frame?)  above the unit<br /><br />This product attached to the wall with the double faced &#34;sticky things&#34;  included. It hasn't fallen off. It dries my hair. I'm happy.
First of all, let's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist.  I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.  What's better than that?
Very happy with this blower dryer so far. Everything works just right. Small, light. Long power cord is great benefit too.
I've been using this dryer for a couple weeks and I feel good about my purchase. I'm not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything but it does seem to have helped  a bit with my flyaway prone hair. I can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer, and I'm amazed at how quiet it is!  I wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that I am very happy.
Best blow dryer my girlfriend has ever had! Bought this and straight iron said she has had all kinds including two hundred dollar straighteners. This is best ever
I have purchased a number of Conair hair dryers - they last forever. This dryer came with a diffuser in the box, which is a great addition. While it does not have a multitude of settings, it has what you need to get your hair dry. It is not insanely loud, either. If you are looking for a good work horse hair dryer that will last; look no further than this Conair.
I agree with the comments that this hair dryer works even better than the one I regularly use and is regular size!  I haven't used it for travel yet as I am still planning my trip to Italy -- I look forward to using the dual voltage feature.  And this isn't too large for packing as some have indicated.  The handle folds nicely and will take up far less room in my suitcase over my regular dryer.
had the same model before but in blue. this is a newer model as i great. loves the cord retraction
I have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg.  This hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both!  It is an incredible hair dryer - quiet and really powerful and it cost less than $100!!!  And it leaves my hair feeling incredible - no frizz or flyways!
Besides the fact that I love the color, this is a dynamo of a blow dryer.  I have been using Conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago.  Their quality is excellent and long lasting.  The retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice.  I highly recommend this product.
Works great! I take it with me for all of my side jobs as a stylist, and it's small and portable enough to go everywhere.
I would defiantly recommend this hair dryer!! It's lightweight, quiet and drys my hair fast without leaving it frizzy! I was hesitant to buy because it was a little on the expensive side but I'm glad I made the purchase.
Can't help but to brag about this to everyone. This hair dryer works so good and dries hair super fast. It is heavy though so don't drop it on your toe like I did! Love all the settings it has.
Compact, dry hair fast. Great buy for the price! It fits in any size suitcases or bags, used it in Europe with no problem.
I have been using it for 3 weeks now, every morning to dry my hair and I love it. The color is nice (red, not pink), it is not too loud, there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures. I use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes. If I use the high temperature, the drying time is about half. There is one feature that I totally love - the RETRACTING CORD - no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer. LOVE IT!
I have had this item for a while, but waited before posting a review. I have had no problems with it at all. It is not super noisy and dries my hair rather quickly. Some people complain of the weight, and while it is not the lighest hair dryer around, it does not wear out my arms when using it.
This is a powerful blower. It shortens the drying time, and it is not that noisy, well if I compare it to the one I had for 4 years. Great quality. I am please my Dominican hair stylist recommended to me. I definitely recommend it to you. It is worth the price.
Great hair dryer with 3 speeds, which is super hard to find!  (I have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed.)  Also folds for travel and has removable concentrator attachment.
Love, love, love it.  Its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is, it actually reels the cord in!!
This dryer does really make a difference in a fuller head of hair appearance using the sonic property of this dryer.  The heat and intensity choices work great and the retraction of the cord is a nice feature!
Easy to use, it has two different attachments and several speeds to choose from. It works well for home use.
We bought this for our rental property and it works very well.  I would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property.
Compact, light, not too noisy compared to others. High quality for the price. Came in perfect condition, I use it every day and it's still perfect.
There was nothing that I really didn't like about it.<br />And these are the things that I liked:<br />Firstly, it's cheap. Secondly, it's small and not so heavy. Thirdly, I've had it for 5 months now and it's still blowing hot air.
I love it came in excellent condition.  I absolutely<br />Love it I have every positive thought about my blow dryer
Quiet, very light and long cord, work as promised, cool air wonderful, medium heat is all required...<br />loved the 2 attachments that came with it.<br />came earlier than expected!
very nice small convenient dryer for travel. I liked this and its a good purchase who need dryer on travel.
Used this hair dryer at a hotel and had to have one!  It's light weight, retract cord and high powered.
It was a present for sis in law for her bday. She loves doing hair, she loved it. !!!!!! :)
Really got what I waz expecting ! Great price and straight from Japan.I'm gonna buy more as a present for my sister!
I like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer. It works well plus takes up little space.
This is the second Sunbeam/Oster &#34;wall&#34; mount hair dryer we have had over<br />perhaps the past twenty years, and we have never been more satisfied.  It<br />looks good on our bathroom wall, and it is not intrusive in any way.  It is also<br />quiet and easy to keep clean.  I recommend it highly.  Also, thanks to Amazon,<br />it is the worlds best shopping source.
It is light weight, easy to hold, and it's two levels of power make it perfect for all hair styling.
Absolutely love this hairdryer. It has a special grip coating that keeps it from slipping around, and is powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly without frizzing
This thing runs day and night at my house and is still going many months later , what more do you need to know
Simply put this is THE best hair dryer I have ever owned. Love the speeds and the ease of use, it's not heavy to hold
I first ordered on of these hair dryers about 5 years ago after using it  at a hotel in Maui. It's light weight and  works well for my baby fine hair. I always have a hard time finding a simple hair dryer that has the right combination of power and heat. The first one I ordered lasted about 3 years. I think that's about the life for this product since it does not have a removable vent/filter to clean. But...after trying a few others I went right back to the tried and true!
I received this blow dryer fast. My other Conair broke after many years. This new one works great & my hair dries fast.
I've never had a blow dryer with a diffuser and I have wavy/curly hair. This diffuser works great and my hair looks great after using it!
This is about the 4th hair dryer I have had that hangs on the wall. I won't have any other style. It makes using the dryer so convenient. You don't have to take it out of the drawer. The little cord hook is very nice.The night light is an additional bonus.
It is soooo small and perfect for travel. It has pretty good power and the travel case was a nice touch.
I've been using this dryer for over 10 years (or close)! It has the best power and can get my hair straight or can diffuse it exactly how I want it with the settings. Will continue buying if anything ever happens to it!
I don't think i'll ever be able to use a regular blow dryer again.  This one is the best ever.
Have lots of hair but the medium heat seems to handle it well. I'm happy with it & hope it last long.
Originally purchased elsewhere for $10 more! Returned that one and got it here cheaper! Been using for a few weeks and loving it. Definitely needed an upgrade and this is a great buy.
Love this hair dryer, I'm a hairstylist I need a hair dryer that drys hair quickly and light in weight because I have to hold it so much throughout the day.<br />I highly recommend.
Great little hair dryer for traveling with. Power is more than adequate for my usage. Wish it came in other colors.
Bought this to replace my old, compact Conair 1600.  Hard to find a small dryer like this that doesn't have a folding handle, has just the right amount of air velocity at each setting, and doesn't come with a lot of &#34;frou-frou&#34; attachments and improvements.  This dryer is perfect.  Simple, efficient, works great.  I'm happy.
I have never paid so much for a blow dryer, but I have NO regrets.  I feel as if it is so worth it and I get a quick and professional blow out.  I expect this to last a very long time, but I would buy another in a heartbeat.
Got dryer pretty quick.  my daughter loves it and she has thick long hair.  Satisfied so far with this product
This is a very nice hair dryer. I like the size. It has a high and low heat which is very comfortable.  It's not too noisy which is nice.  It can be cleaned too which is very easy. The price is very good I have bought others at twice the price and only half as good! Very happy with it.
This Hair Dryer is great and my really loved it as a gift, I would recommend this to all my friends and family
I got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her. This hair dryer is TINY! Don't be fooled by it's size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer. It's actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts, though her drying time has remained the same. It's also the perfect travel size hair dryer. Heck, it fits in her purse! I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well. It does not come with a 'cool shot' setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult. The attachments are tiny as well, so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does. However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  I don't have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser.
Easy to use. Easy to store. Dries quickly. Nice design and fits in with my bathroom dÃ©cor. I would definitely buy product again if needed or for a gift.
I needed a new blow dryer and because of the good reviews on this one I decided to get it.  it works great would definitely recommend it
I'm a big fan of Panasonic hair Dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny .<br />fair price and does a great job keeping my hair straight with a bounce and weight in it , I blow dry my hair then use the KURUKURU after I spray my hair with a heat protector .. P.S ( My Hair type is wavy ) :-)
Excellent power, variety of settings, great price! Difuser is perfect for curly hair. If you need a hair dryer, choose this one.
My old Conair burnt out after about 10 years of use. I debated spending more money on a pricier model, but saw the reviews for more costly hair dryers were hit or total miss. I decided on this dryer, it came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser. I've used both and I love this dryer. It gets the job done. I just wish that the cord was retractable (like my old Conair dryer).
I finally broke down and purchased a new blow dryer after mine started sparking.. really pleased with the purchase! I've now had this for several months and no issues with the surface peeling off, which I was worried about from other reviews.
This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love. The first day I got it,  I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water- it was completely submerged. It immediately shut off as soon as it hit the water.  I left it to dry and the next day I plugged it in and it WORKED.  I was pretty impressed.
This is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others I've had. I am very happy with this purchase. I keep it on neutral ions for the most part. I haven't noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings, but I wasn't expecting to anyway. It seems like a gimmick. I was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has.
Blow-dries in half the time of my old, dinosaur of a hair dryer!  I have used it for about a month now, with no problems at all!  Would definitely recommend!
This is the second one I bought... because my daughter stole my first one!!! The ease to travel with it is amazing, but I use it every single day!! I love that it dries so fast and is so light weight!!! None of the clunky other driers would ever do now!! I am spoiled!
I had this blowdryer for 2+ years when it blew out and had to be replaced (totally my fault by the way, didnt realize you are suppose to clean out the back of blowdryers. fuzz had gotten in my filter and the motor blew). When I went to buy a new one, I wanted to replace with same model because I loved it so much. It dries my long thick hair much quicker than other models and I do think it is better on your hair (so they advertise, and I so like to think!) The cord keeper is a great feature too and keeps corn from getting all weird and twisted. Get this! Your hair will thank you!
I've had a few different hair dryers and by far this is my favorite. Fast, powerful, and lite. Definitely recommend it.
This is a quick drying dryer, which is what we all want, lol.  The retractable cord is a little snappy, beware of it flipping the cord against you.  I love the color, very bright and cheerful.  So far so good.
Very nice hair dryer. I first got to try this in a hotel in New York. I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair. I knew I had to get one when I got home! It dries your hair nicely without cooking your head! My old dryer got so hot it was uncomfortable. Not this one. I'm very happy with my purchase. Great price too!
This hair dryer has exceeded my standards.  I love it when doing my daughter hair she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair. After drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy.  My daughter loved it.. it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful. .. I love it...
As a man I take pride in always being ready at a moments notice, but if you have a girlfriend you know that's not always true and sitting around waiting for her to get ready can be a pain when all you want to do is get to the party and have a few beers with your friends, with this bad boy she can dry/do her hair in 20mins or less (not including shower time, make up time and dress up time) Imagine waiting only an hour instead of 3! This has saved me time, money on the electric bill, and my relationship, plus chicks love leopard print, and it works great on my dogs (don't tell my gf)
Both my wife and daughter love this hair dryer. They use it weekly without complaining about it which for me sounds great.
Best blow dryer for your $ !!!! I have coarse thick long hair... And this blow dryer gets my hair dry in no time! Definitely worth it! :)
This dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud.  I love that it is foldable and retractable - makes it easier for storage and for traveling.
This dryer is very lightweight, quiet and it dries hair quickly. The three heat settings are great and the touch is nice
I love it, it works great.  I wish it had the ability to regrow hair, since my hair line is receding at an alarming rate though!
My old blow dryer just quit on me one day so I ordered this one and it works great.  It came with a curling head and a flat head and I have had no issues yet.  Has good air strength and lets you choose cool, warm or hot.
For its size I am amazed at the &#34;horsepower&#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.
This was my best purchase yet!<br />The hair dryer straightens as it dries; however, it doesn't burn my hair.<br />I am enjoying this hair dryer so much, I'm thinking of getting a backup in case something happens to this one.
...worth five stars just for that. Quiet, powerful with several settings and a comfortable ergonomic handle. Convenient hook keeps the blow dryer out of our way next to the vanity when not in use.
I like this hair dryer because it works quickly, doesn't over dry my hair so there's no damage for using it, and it doesn't weigh much.
Bought this for a 2-week trip to Chile.  Worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on High Heat and High Fan when operating on 220.  Once I got home to the US I moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now.  It has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate.<br /><br />The retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it's easier to store at home too.
Looks sheik, works great, and I can see this piece staying with me for a long time.  I've had it for a year and it's still going strong.
I Received This Dryer In A Few Days After Ordering It....And Im So Glad That I Did!!! My Hair Takes A Long Time To Dry Typically; But Not W This Dryer.My Hair Is Very Thick & To Dry It Usually Is A Process. I Love This Dryer Simply Because It Dries My Hair In Record Time.!!! I Would Recommend This Dryer To Anyone.For The Price; This Dryer Is Amazing!!!
This is a godd little hair blower--no ions--which I don't want since I need bulk, not flat.  I gave one to a friend who doesn't have too much money and she loves it too.  I'm leaving them at my nieces' (three) homes so I have a reliable, good hair blower whenever I visit them.
This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned!! It is worth every penny.. I went to my local Sally's and bought two they were 35.00 each.. I had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and Sally's does not have these so I found it on Amazon thank goodness.. If you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it. Your hair looks great when you use this one... I will never plan to buy another dryer except this one.. I can't say enough love this one so I highly recommend this dryer..
This is a great dryer! My first one finally died after 5 years of constant use and I ended up trying a similar Gold N Hot and it stopped working and overheated on the first use. I quickly ordered the Andis and have had no issues! I have long curly hair and it drys  my hair in under 20 min. I will definitely purchase this product a third time once I've worn the one I just bought out.
I have two portable hair dryers with foldable handles.......one I keep in the bathroom at home and one in the roll-aboard.  I like this little dryer for every day use.  It's strong enough to do the job on short hair and doesn't take up much space.
We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!  The new one outdoes the previous model!
I used this blowdryer in a Marriott hotel and fell in love with how quick it dries!! So glad I found it on your site!! The price is awesome too!!
Nice size, good weight, excellent airflow. Great styling my hair, and it's really thick and fairly long. Retractable cord is a plus.
I have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry as I get older. When I would get a haircut I would always leave the salon with my hair wet because I thought drying it would cause it to be frizzier, my stylist proved me wrong at my last visit. So now that I knew I could dry my hair and it would look good I searched the dryers for curly hair and read all the reviews and chose the Conair YOU. I really like the fact that I can dry my hair and have it look great in about 15 minutes and that's using the low setting. It also comes with a defuser, which is a key to blowdrying curly hair. This is a great little dryer for naturally curly hair!
I have very thick, long hair that takes over an hour to dry, I bought this product so I could save some time by working on my laptop while my hair is drying.. I am pleased with it so far. It's very quiet and adjustable. I haven't figured out a way for it to dry the underneath back part of my hair but it honestly takes less than 5 minutes to blow dry after sitting under this for a cycle. The only con, is the storage aspect obviously. It's big but the height can be adjusted to make it a little smaller. It's very portable and durable.
The only hair dryer manufactured with the vents on the side.  This is essential for my work, the newer backk vent ones are worthless to me.
This hair dryer is extremely affordable, especially when compared to other brand hair dryers of equal ability.  This dryer is easy to use and is great for any female in your life.
Dries hair quickly.  Excellent price.  I have 15 amp service, and it doesn't blow fuses.  It should blow a fuse on high (given the watt rating, but it doesn't). Go figure.
I love this product so far! The heat setting is just perfect for me because I have natural hair. I put it to my desired heat setting and it dries my hair great without the heat damage and the comb attachment doesn't pull on my hair, it glides right through while it dries. I gave it 5 stars because I haven't experienced any flaws yet. Hopefully it lasts longer.
I wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast.  This is a fantastic dryer.  My hair is curly and midlength and it dries in 7 minutes!  And it does a fantastic job of smoothing it out, even on my worse days!  I love it.
For some time now I've been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and I have finally found it!! I love that this dryer is so quiet I can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep! At 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet.<br /><br />I also love the Ionic technology. My husband & I were a bit skeptical about this feature, but now that I've tried it I'm a believer! With the Ionic generator turned OFF my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily. With the Ionic Generator turned ON the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft! It's also helping with my split ends.<br /><br />The 3 heat seatings are great too! I believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62Â°F and the hottest is approximately 223Â°F. It gets really hot, but it's great that you can use the cool shot feature to &#34;set&#34; you style when done.<br /><br />Bottomline: quietest dryer I've ever used and totally worth the money too!
So convenient for me to do other things while drying my hair without having to lug one of the self standing one around
I have been looking for a great blow dryer and actually the salon I go to the uses this dryer.  My hairdresser told me that it's a very good blow dryer and it does not damage your hair like the other dryers.  This turbo 3200 dryer dries my hair very quickly and I am happy with the end result.<br /><br />I recommend this dryer to anyone who is looking for a really good dryer.  It's a little expensive, but who cares if it's going to give great results then it's worth the money.
Took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long<br />blond hair.<br />It is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking<br />too much space.
My hair stylist had recommended it, after I told her it seemed to take forever to dry my hair at home, yet minutes in her salon. It's a great product, and not as high pitched as other dryers I've had.
This dryer is excellent. It gets hotter then the ones in the salon. Best $104 ever spent. I recommended it to all my friends and fam.
I love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever I need it.<br />Conair is an excellent product.  I love it.
I love how lightweight this thing is, while still being powerful.  I gave it to my mom for Christmas, and when I'm home, I usually go into her bathroom to use it because it's better than mine.
I needed new hair dryers for upstairs and downstairs bathrooms and didn't want to pay too much. I don't do a lot of styling, mostly just wash and dry, so I didn't need a lot of attachments. This one suited me perfectly. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth.<br />My old dryer was a Conair and worked well for years. I hope this one lasts as long.<br />To anyone looking for a nice simple hair dryer, reasonably priced, I would recommend this one.
This hair dryer functions really well. It is strong and hot enough, and it can also be cool. It is pretty light and doesn't vibrate in hand. I recommend it!
Dries my hair very quickly, and dries it straight. I have wavy hair and this hairdryer gets the wave out if I want to.
This is a must! I have thin naturally curly hair and I didn't want to damage my hair with a blow dryer that was gonna be too rough on me, I gave this one a try and OMG the diffuser and heat settings are perfect. I still have to use it for straightening, I'm sure its gonna be perfect though
I used this dryer in Italy. They have a higher current, so I'm glad I read the directions. I set the dial to the correct current, and only used low setting. It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.<br />Also, it comes with a little diffuser that works well. How cute!
I would recommend this dryer. works great, I have very thick hair and it dries it quickly. Fast delivery and item was as described.
Got this for my gf for Christmas and she couldn't be happier.  She likes how quiet it is and the extra piece on the end of it.  Not sure what that's called or what it's used for but all that matters is that she's happy.
I have fine hair (but a lot of it) that is very prone to frizzing.  This dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it.  I was using a chi rocket, and this is much easier for me to use.
My hair is very dense and attracts static VERY quickly.  My usual blowdryer (and all the others I've owned in the past) left my hair dry but pieces of my hair sticking straight up and I'd always have to use a smoother to tame them.  Thankfully I showered at a friend's house one day and borrowed this dryer.  I came out of the bathroom and my friend was like OMG YOUR HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.  No flyaways.  No static.  My hair looked better after JUST DRYING IT than it usually did after I spent 30 minutes styling it.<br /><br />I immediately ordered this on Amazon Prime ten minutes later and tossed my old dryer as soon as it came in.  I have since bought two more for my best friends, and they swear by it as well.
I have many fancy and expensive hair dryer but I fell in love with this one when I was staying in the ritz carlton hotel. I notice that it is foldable, drys fast, and not too hot--just everything i needed for a hair dryer. So I ordered this one from amazon and I have been using this for years, still works great!
I love this blow dryer... it doesn't get to hot and it's easy to hold and use... I would buy from this seller again
I have re-ordered this product because it is Light-weight, powerful, reasonably priced and my wife wanted one. I highly recommend this product.
Makes my hair nice and soft, glad I ordered it and would recommend it to anyone who has curly unruly hair. thanks Kathy
Bought this combination hair dryer/ hit air curler for use when I am in Japan.  It worked perfectly for my fine hair.  Maybe I did pay a premium for buying it in the US, but I did not have take time out of my business or pleasure schedule to find one when I got to Japan.  I Highly recommend this for any woman who plans to travel in Japan and wants a combinatuion hair dryer and hair curler
Hair dryer works well.  It was inexpensive but still offered three speeds and three heat settimgs.  Would recommend purchase of this product.
This dryer is awesome.  Very sturdy and well made.  Gives my thin hairs lots of volume.  It would be perfect if the handle folder after it retracted the cord.  It's a minor complaint for such a good dryer though.
The heat is SUPER STRONG, so I would advise people to be careful. Some hair types can handle heat better than others, but heat in general isn't the best for your hair. I personally like it. I have transitioning hair (relaxed to natural African American hair, it's extremely wavy, coily and stubborn), so the heat really helps me a lot.
I have been using this dryer for the last year and love it! I have thick, long hair, and the high heat settings make drying/straightening my hair super quick. It also doesn't singe/burn hair like other dryers I've used in the past. And as an added bonus, it is lightweight so no tiring morning hair routine. The attachments have also held up well over the last year, though I wish the small attachment was a little more narrow than it is. I'm buying one for my mother today.
I love this dryer. This is my third one. I have purchased more expensive ones and this one is still better. The air flow is more directed so I get smooth hair without fly-aways like so many new dryers. It has a good temp as well.
I use the comb attachment and my hair is dry and full of volume in record time!  Much better product than I expected!
We were very pleased with this purchase. The dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand.
love it
I have very thick and frizzy hair.....I love the multiple speeds and the heat settings that it has. I wish it was a little lighter.  I can deal with that though.... I love it ....After I blow dry my hair I barely need to straighten it. Reduces the frizz GREATLY!!! Comes with the two adapters pieces which work great.
I purchased this item because of the retractable cord.  It is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy.  I also purchased the Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder so I could keep it on my counter top.  I would recommend this dryer.
I have VERY thick hair, and this really did cut down on my drying time.  I use the cold button when I'm done and it seems to make my hair a little more manageable.
After using this hair dryer at a Marriott on our way home, she just had to have one.  Compact, variable heat and blower settings, just what she wanted.  Fair price including the extra for shipping.  She's quite pleased and that's what it's all about.  Even the retractable cord is neat.
This is my second version of this hair dryer.  The first one I used for several years and it finally gave up the ghost.  I like the fact that it folds to a small size and it gets hot enough to actually style my hair.  I hope this one lasts as long as the first one.  I have had a couple of travel hair dryers, but this one is better by far.  One good feature is this one does not have such a loud, high pitched scream as most small hair dryers.  The cold air button is also a BIG plus, since I use that when styling my hair with a round brush.  Overall, this is a great product.
Does a great job and can't beat the price.  I can't believe the difference it makes between my old hair dryer and this one.
This dryer is nice and quiet and is very similar to my old Vidal Sasson Quiet Style VS750 dryer.  I like the controls as they are easer to use with the push style versus the slide style of button.  Very happy to have this after trying two other dryers.  The other two were either too loud or to strong.  I have very fine hair and I don't need a hair dryer that can basically blow my head off of my shoulders.  I don't see anywhere on the box that it is by VS but if it is, I am very glad as I had the VS750 for 14 years and hope I have this one for a long time.
We cruise a lot, and this blow dryer is perfect. It's powerful, yet portable.<br />I love the folding handle. What a space saver. Thank you
It does the job for me.  A bit heavy but otherwise is just what I wanted.  I would buy again.
Says it's perfect for traveling, and she loves the cold temp button for when she doesn't want the high heat.
I have purchased these over the years and like the fact that this one had a nite lite. I am still using this particular one and still have one I bought previously without a nite lite.
I bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter. I also own one and so does my other daughter. We absolutely love this hair dryer. It has 3 speed settings (low, med, high), 2 temperature settings (low, high), and a cool button. It is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made. I've had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day I purchased it. If you are considering buying this product I would highly recommend it!!
Works great.  Not too heavy. Love the retractable cord.  Feel good knowing it is ionizing and ceramic for the safety of my hair.
Good quality, drys quickly without frying your hair.  Not as noisy as some dryers.  Light weight, sturdy.  It seems like it will last.  I would recommend it.
Product was purchased to blow dry my dog's hair because his doggy towels don't fully dry him thus I would recommend this product.
This tiny hair dryer has a lot of power behind it; fits well into the vanity drawer; and easily packed for travel.
I had this dryer for years and they don't sell it in the stores around me any more so I was so happy when I found it on Amazon!  Love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls! I ordered an extra one for the future, my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers. Well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself!
it's a pleasure hold this dryer in your hands, powerful yet elegant. I have had many of different dryers, this one is worth more than the price.
Love the dryer...salon quality...powerful, but easy to handle.  I'm glad there is also a cool setting to finish off the styling.
Was on a business trip and this was the hair dryer in my room at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis.  Loved it so I got on Amazon and ordered one. It was waiting on my porch after I got home!  Small, yet powerful and I like that I can control both the heat level and the air flow level.  A great dryer for travelling.
This is amazing. It really is quiet. It looks great on the wall too!  Very efficient, I have been using an older model and this<br />very powerful but so quiet. It has the hi and low and it's so comfortable to hold for this grandma!!  I love the added feature, the little side hook that holds the cord up once the dryer is snapped back in the holder.you have thought of everything!
I have this same hair dryer in the purple/pink shade, and got this for my mom as a gift.<br /><br />I've had my hair dryer for about three months now and I use it daily, and it's still going strong. It is a powerful hair dryer, and yes, it is loud-but it has a low setting if that bothers you.<br /><br />I don't see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as I've read all over the reviews; it's not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either. It cuts my drying time literally in half, so who cares? The 'cool shot' button works really well which was also a huge plus for me. This dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won't fail as easily. Overall, it's a solid product and I've been very happy with mine.<br /><br />Side Note: Conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them, which sealed the deal for me for a $30 dryer. I called and asked Conair about this directly before I purchased mine through Amazon. It doesn't matter it's through a third party.
I bought for my wife and she is really happy with this blower, I strongly recommends this blower. Go and buy one
I didn't realize how great this hair dryer was until I went on vacation without it. My hair was so dry and icky, I couldn't wait to get home to use it. I will never leave home without it. Worth the money, great product, works like it says!
1) I can now say I own the worlds smallest Ferrari!<br />2) This hair dryer lives up to the hype!!<br />Not going to lie, I was skeptical at first.  I hadn't purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow.  After some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews I decided to go for it.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer doesn't get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other!  My hair feels softer after using it and I don't even need to use the straightener afterwards.  I personally don't have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it's no louder than any other hair dryer I've used.  If anything I think it's slightly quieter than most.  What used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes, literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry  (the first time I used it I timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds!).  It is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time!  Beyond happy I bought this and I would easily recommend to anyone.
Thank you thank you thank you for making a hair dryer with a retractable cord.  I cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is!  The jury is still out on the dryer itself as I've not had it long enough to know its durability/reliability, but so far so good.
Really small, but does a good job of drying. I just wish there was a diffuser -my other Conair one kinda fits so I use it, but it falls on the floor sometimes.
PACKS ENOUGH POWER NICE & COMPACT. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS HAIR DRYER TO ANY ONE ESPECIALLLY IF THEY TRAVEL !!
Amazing price for a great performing product.  Quiet.<br /><br />Ships on time from a great vendor.  Now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer.
My old, reliable hair blower was dying, and I looked around for something similar.  I found the Andis, and it's great!  Light weight (very important) and terrific drying capability.  Mater of fact, I bought it before my other one died, so it was in the ready.  Great choice for a hair blower.
I like the color, the attachments, and the retractable cord. I didn't feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud. If you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet. I'd buy this again, I think it was a great value for the price.
I already own this hair dryer for a year and it is still working fine. It is small, light-weight, does not tire your hand and blows just the right amount of air. I highly recommend it. I first used it at a hotel and then bought one for my personal use. I am glad I did.
This hairdryer has great power and different heat settings. The price and quality are great, it is very heavy duty. The automatically recoiling cord is a bonus!
I am really picky about hair dryers since I have long very think hair. I used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free. It usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes. SO HAPPY!! I just got it, but so far so good!
I keep my hair high and tight so I'm not drying long hair but it is thick hair. Like a rug you know? It takes 2-3 minutes to dry my hair with this dryer. It has sufficient heat on low for my hair so if you put it on high it's probably overkill. The balance and weight is good as well.  I've always bought Conair brand and my last one would probably still be alive if it hadn't got broken by our movers. For $11 and Amazon's return policy I figured I couldn't go wrong and so far I'm happy with the product. I'd buy it again.
Great Product, easy to install and easy to clean the filter. Works very well!<br /><br />Thanks Much!<br />Dean Huey<br />Columbus, Nebraska
This is an excellent blow dryer, as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth, frizz-free shine. My hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look. Great purchase, I expect this item to last quite a while, as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years.
This is the second one of these I have purchased because I dropped my other one and broke it. This hair dryer seriously does make my hair smoother, and when you use the concentrating attachment, it really works!
The motor is quieter than dryers I've owned in the past. Easy to operate. Love the cord reel! Does a fast job of drying my hair.
May be old style but works like it should!  Finally one that won't die every 16 months! I love it
It's really not that heavy o_O like holding a well-sized book in my hand lolol.<br />It's also not very loud, just what I expect hearing at the hair salon to be honest.<br />Some people say it's ugly, but who cares? It's not like I'm going to parade around town blow drying people with unsavory hairstyles.
I thought I may of overpaid for just a hair dryer - but this product works very well.  It is effecient & drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine!  Friends & family that use it also notice a positive difference.
Conair 1875-Watt Pro Style Hair Dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair.  I wash and dry every other day and so far it seems gentle (along with good hair health product).  It reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before.  Also the color blends nicely with medium-wood rustic style.
I bought this hairdryer after reading the reviews. I was going to buy a more expensive one but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try. It was worth it! It works better than a more expensive one I had prior to this one. It dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look. I highly recommend this hair dryer- for the price you can't beat it.
Bought for trip but tried out before hand to make sure that it would work on my trip. This dryer woks better than my regular dryer and is not too loud.  It collapses small enough and is not too heavy. Also, my daughter loves the color.
I have 2 other blow dryers, and I will be selling them.  This dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever had. It is really awesome this is why I gave it a 5. I would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own.
This dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it!
Who knew all hair dryers were not created equal!  Great price for a hair dryer that doesn't fry your hair.<br /><br />I have super thick hair and this dryer cuts my dry time in half compared to my last old cheap dryer.<br /><br />Price is good, great product!
This was an exact replacement for an older model that failed.  Just what the wife wanted.  Hope it outlasts us both.
cord disappears, this one is just fine.  My sister was visiting and said &#34;That's the shortest hair dryer cord I've ever seen.&#34; until I showed her how it retracks and pulls out at will.  Decent hairdryer/decent price.
I like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings.  I just like having the options.  I also like that the cord is fairly long.  Some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet.  I will say, though, if you like your dryer to get super HOT this may not be the one for you.  It does get really warm but not &#34;burn your skin&#34; hot like some of them!  I'm happy with it.
I have been using it now for almost 2 years with no problems yet.  Still blows like the day it came out of the box
This is my second Twin Turbo and I truly love it.  It is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding. It gives my hair volume and never over dries.  I highly recommend this product.
this works great, was brand new in the box, I used all the time.  I was very happy with this product
Powerful and has a REALLY hot setting, a warm setting and button for &#34;cool&#34; which has no heat at all.  It's very good and I'm very pleased.  My last Conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we've used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months (had to defrost it every week), and I used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer--which is now it's exclusive use (I have a dog grooming business).  So these are workhorse machines!
First unit shipped had its case broken.  Second unit super and works well.  We had looked for this device for a long time.  We ran our of finding old units at rummage sales etc.
I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok. I usually use this and another dryer, both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me.
I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok.  I really can't say that the ionic action it's supposed to do does much for my hair, since I usually use both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn't terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it's ok with her, it's fine with me.
When I was staying at a four-star hotel (a Marriott I believe) this hair dryer was in the bathroom.  I liked it.  I made a note of the model number, and I ordered it from Amazon.  It is a great dryer.  I use it every day and, when traveling, I have yet to find a dryer in a hotel that does the job as well as this one.
I have 4a/b natural hair and I don't like to use direct heat (blow dryer/flat iron) on it very often. I ordered the dryer because I often don't have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing/conditioning and styling. This dryer is great. It was easy to assemble and seems to be durable. The tempature and timer settings work well. It get's the job done!
As a hairstylist I have used MANY drying tools and NOTHING compares to this dryer.  I will never use another the famous CHI including.  CHI doesn't come close to this one!!!! And the cost you just can't beat it.  I had ,my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly, It hasn't completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so I'm buying another because I will NOT work without this dryer.  It will not disappoint....HINT  NOTHING manages frizz except products.  So don't think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that's nonsense.
Great product!<br />I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.
First discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out.
I needed a replacement dryer.  This does the job. It's super light, and cute looking.  At first I didn't think I would like it because it seemed really lacking in power.  However, it dries hair EXTREMELY quickly, so the lack of power isn't an issue.
This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years. One morning it just stopped heating up, so I hurried to the store for another, but couldn't find anywhere! Thank goodness for Amazon ^_^ My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look. And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I'm really glad I was able to find an exact match here.
I hate weak hair dryers. But this one is AMAAAZING!!! It's got A LOT of power!! I don't really use a lot of the cool setting on it  ..but it feels like an  air conditioner because of how cold it gets. If you want a great hair dryer for cheap this is absolutely worth it. The only thing I could say that would be a con is the cord. I wish it was retractable.
I used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing I came home and bought!  Great power, easy to hold and store.
It is powerful and easy to use.  Dry the hair in 2-3 minutes (my hair is about 2 inches long).  Great product.
I thought that hair dryers are just that - hair dryers. This is not your standard hair dryer - it can basically style your hair without applying any gel or styling products on your hair. It is that amazing. And it keeps the style of your hair for the rest of the day.
I had this exact same hair dryer - purchased at a retail store - for years.  When looking for a new one, I bought this one again on Amazon.
This is the best travel dryer I have used, and I have bought many. Only negative - it isn't dual voltage so it won't work in countries with 240 volt wiring.
It dries all this hair really fast.  Very light.  Bigger than I thought due to it's weight but it works.  Love it.
Love my new dryer. Much better that the ones I've had before. I like that you can adjust the temperature.
I don't put a lot of fuss into my hair, but recently we moved to a much different climate (hot and humid). Since I didn't want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry, I wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer. For the price, this one is fantastic. The hot setting is a bit hot (but aren't they all?) but the cool setting is really strong, so I use that most often. For all the power it puts out, the dryer is small too, which is great.<br />If I had to make a complaint, it would be that the cord could be longer, and it isn't coiled so it doesn't stretch at all.
I used this in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, where electricity is very poorly done and is very weak. I never blew a fuse and was absolutely amazed!
arrived quickly. Works great and has all the features I need. Amazing how cheap you can get a good hair dryer these days. Great seller and product.
Its a little heavy but works great, the heat settings work well and I believe this will last a long time as compared to the discount ones that don't last long.
I bought this to replace a previous Conair hair dryer, despite reviews that said it would be too heavy.  Once the cord is unwound, it's really not heavy (and you wouldn't use it with the cord retracted).  Not having to manually wind up the cord for storage is such a time and headache saver.  It makes it so easy to put it away everyday in a drawer instead of leaving it out on the counter, still plugged in.
It is a really good and strong blow dryer which last a long time.It is a really good brand very good for long hair
Very nice  color and design.especially with very very low noises,so that you can use it in the early morning.will recommend friends to have it.
I purchased the Leopard print Babyliss Nano Titanium Portofino 6600 Hair Dryer.  It definitely cuts the drying time for my hair.  I am glad that the 'cool' setting is indeed that, COOL AIR, not just unheated air.  My hair has appeared shinier with less frizz.  I am very happy with this purchase.
Great dryer.  I use attachment so my hair doesn't blow all over place. Dries hair quick! Looks good. Hope it lasts forever.
It is a little noisy, but works well with strong wind. The price is attractive and it has good quality
I had a dryer like this and after 4 years it died. Hard to find one like it, but Amazon had it. Perfect for drying thick wavy hair. This works so much better for me than the 2000 watt ion dryers. They frizz my hair. Hard to find a &#34;regular&#34; dryer. Thank younAmazon:)
This hairdryer work exactly like it was described. All features work as expected. Comfortable to hold, not to loud and cord retracts just fine. Would definitely recommend.
Powerful blow dryer. I love it. I use it for my hair and I use it after giving my poodle and Maltese a bath. I highly recommend this blow dryer. Will purchase again from this seller.
This hair dryer very handily keeps the dryer out of the way and the is very conveniently located on the wall near my vanity.
This little baby is awesome! I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer. It gets really hot (but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything), and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer. Very lightweight too. Love it!
Our first Conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use. This replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill, compact, lightweight and powerful. The price is right as well.
I tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it. I ordered it when I got home and was not disappointed. This blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently!
I was looking for a quiet hair dryer that worked well & this one is perfect.  A little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first, but I'm sure that I just have to get used to it  -- i recommend it without reservation.
all hair dryers should have just the &#34;cool&#34; air function.  I like it, others like it the cool air is powerful and I think it does not make my hair fall off. get it.
I love this Hair Dryer. I have thick long hair and it take around 5 mins to dry my hair.. Love it
So far so good. I've had it about 2 months. Cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz.
Great product, great airflow. I bought one a few years back. Still working.<br />A little big for travel. However I bought another for the guest bath.<br />Everything I've ever wanted in a hair blower.<br />Delivery was prompt.
Reasonably priced, light, works well, you can turn off the heat so that it's just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair...got it for the GF who loves it.  Amazon's price is much better than anything I could find locally.
I use this as my home hairdryer, not just when I'm traveling although the bag it comes with makes it perfect for that too. It doesn't have a lot of power but my hair is really fine so a lot of hairdryers seem a little bit of overkill for me. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with really thick hair though as it might take a lot longer to dry.
This works fabulous! Dries my hair in 1/2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my HSI professional hair straightener, followed with HSI Argan Oil. Worth every PENNY :)
This hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power. The rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold.
Best $10 bucks spent. Put in on my mirror. Salon looking blowouts in minutes.  Why didn't I get this sooner?
I have had these for sooo long without any regret (except for blowing my hair out)...  Small, compact, quality product.  How often do you hear that about a small hair dryer?  Great product and for the price...
Of all of the dryers I've owned in my life- this is my favorite.  I've only been using it for 3 days and I'm in love!
This dryer is very light weight, two heat and air settings, dries hair quickly and quietly. Very glad i was able to locate it after using it in a hotel i recently stayed in.
This is the second time I've purchased this hair dryer as I loved the first one so much.  It gets hot enough to straighten as it dries.  Would recommend highly.
I received my leopard Babyliss dryer from Beauty And, and I believe it is the real thing - not a counterfit. The packaging, accessories, and dryer all appear to be very well-made with great attention to detail. The cord is quite thick and long; you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine. It is the best hairdryer I have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes, without much heat at all (seems like it would cause less damage to hair). It is certainly worth the $59.95 I paid for it.
Compact for travel and very powerful.can't beat it for the price. Recommend it for anyone looking for a travel hairdryer or enen great for home use.
I love this blow dryer! It's the most user friendly dryer I have ever used. It is well made & dries hair very nicely, without burning it. I love the retractable cord. The blow dryer folds shut so it's easier to store.  Cant believe I found such a great affordable blow dryer.
Curly hair here. I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.<br /><br />I love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.<br /><br />My finger always ached after using my last one, which only had that blue button and not the addt'l setting.
Works well.  Very convenient to use.  Just like in hotels.  Compact design takes up very little room on the wall.
I LIKE AND IT WAS VERY AFFORDABLE.I USED IT TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I WAS PLEASED.I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT BUT IT SAVED ME MONEY:-)
Wonderful product. Very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing. I would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price. WNC
would recommend this for anyone, works great, runs fine and is perfect for what I needed it for. Don't hesitate to buy this nice piece
This blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip! It is not difficult to hold or maneuver.  The comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable.. And great for tender scalps as well as the cool shot button! I chose this one because my hairdresser recommended it. She has a wide range of hair dryers but This blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip! It is not difficult to hold or maneuver.  The comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable..

It has all of the settings (hot, warm & cold) plus the settings are on a slide as opposed to the toggle settings. You don't have to worry about  accidentally changing temperatures or turning drier off in the middle of styling you hair. I also like the retracting cord, it makes storing so much easier.
I got this hair dryer b/c I wanted a no-frills, sturdy hairdryer, and that's exactly what I got. It performs exceptionally well and I have even dried - wait for it - CHICKENS w/ it outside. It's that sturdy. :) B/c I'm a woman I'm not using the little blue button; regardless, this is an awesome piece of equipment.
I've only used this a few times so far, but I really love it.  I've had difficulty finding a dryer that 1) doesn't fry curly hair, 2) isn't too heavy when drying the back of my head, 3) doesn't sound like a jet taking off, 4)has a diffuser, and 4) has separate heat and power settings - with the warm actually warm, not hot.<br /><br />This dryer does all that - I'm a very happy camper!
I am a flight attendant and many hotels I stay in have this hair dryer and I LOVE it! I had to order one for home!!
Had a similar one before and missed it when it finally died. I probably had it ten years or more.
I really needed a good blow dryer to dry & straighten my hair and this one made my hair look really healthy. I love it.
Let me first explain two things-<br />One being that I work the nightly re-stock shift at Sephora and have my pick of any high end professional hair dryer at 30-50% off sale costs and I still chose this for many reasons. Secondly, I have used the same Revlon Ionic $15-20 blowdryer since I was about 16years old and never had any problems with it. I always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so.<br /> My hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave. My hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when I blew it dry but I just figured that was part of the drying process. One day while at work I was looking at a T3 and discussing how my hair frizzes, i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer. I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general. I wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it. After ONE use I could tell a huge difference. It doesnt dry my hair any faster though. I dont have any frizz and it is smoother, smells better, not to hot to touch, and a lot more shine! I really do recommend this to any woman (or man) who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind...go with this one first!
I am a professional stylist and this blow dryer gets the job done!!! It is excellent for straightening natural African American hair.
I got this for my daughter for she like to do her hair a lot and washes it every day
Very affordable, reviews were accurate.  It is quieter than my old one and quick.  No need to spend a lot of money on a dryer when you have the quality with Conair.
I am a 27yr old black woman and i use this dryer to dry my 20in malaysian body wave full sew in. it dried my braids completely so if you're wondering if it works for weave yes. I've only used it once since i bought it and once again to quickly dry my boyfriends boxers last minute and it worked for that too lol so im pretty satisfied. so far so good, thanks!
I had an older model of this same hair dryer for several years (5-7?) and it was great. Recently, it started making some funny sounds while in use, so I decided it was about time to upgrade. For the price, there's really no better option than this one - it's relatively lightweight, easy to maneuver, and makes quick work of drying my long, thick hair. I've never had an expensive, fancy hair dryer, so I can't speak to whether this is better or not, but I'd say you can't beat the price for the quality.
I love it!! I have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it!
I am not very good at styling my hair but I find this dryer seems to be the correct temperature and has the directional stream going in the right direction.  Very easy to use.  I had used the dryer at my daughters and so decided to purchase it.  I would highly recommend it
I bought this to blow dry my baby's hair. It is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair. It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp.
This dryer has great power and really does help keep your hair from frizzing.<br />It's great, and it has lots of power, or little, depending on the setting.
I think this is great for travel and at home.  You just sit and get your hair dryed and device is small enough to walk around with.
no clue about the bad reviews...this dryer gets my hair good and dry. And it dries really fast too! Its a keeper!
I have had this hair dryer for several months now and am very satisfied.  I purchased this model as my daughter has used the same (former model) for years.  I highly recommend this purchase :)
This hairdryer is superb. Like that I can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful. Also like the folding handle. It is made for a woman's hand; easy to hold and handle.
I chose this dryer based on the great ratings it got. I am highly pleased with it. Works well, has all the temp. settings needed. I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don't think one of them would have been better. Highly  recommend!
Today,( 3/14/14) that I used my hair dyer, I have to say I just love it. My hair is naturally curly but takes so, long too dry. I have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy.  I started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when I compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so, all I paid was 104.00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling. I also colored my hair an I use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so, this will make for a better job on my color. Thank you so so so so so much......
works perfect for us, not too big and not too small, wife luvs the ease of it on the wall
Excellent my wife love it, this is one  of the best hair dryer Would live to recommend because is silence and efficient.
This hair dryer was to replace my wife's previous Conair travel hair dryer. This one is a little noisier than her old one, but is by no means a problem noise-wise. It still is much quieter than many she has used in the past.'<br /><br />The dryer drys her hair well and quickly. Plus it was a great price on Amazon.
Use this for my dog.  It has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath.  He hates baths. He would not give any thing associated with it 5.
Prefer this dryer for many years as it isn't too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair. For medium size it is lightweight. I don't use the attachments for my shorter hair. Dryer lasts for many years.
I have used this dryer for years and I love it. Being a hairstylist ...we are rough on dryers and this one takes it to the bank!
A great dryer.  Always handy, but not in the way.  This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time.
I have short hair, so use this as my daily hair dryer. Very compact, strong heat and airflow.  Warning: it's a bit loud.
Love Love Love this hair dryer.  This is my 3rd one over the course of many years.  I not only use in my home but in my RV.  Great power and the size is just right .  Hangs on wall and that is a plus because it's at you fingertips when needed.  This one just purchased replace one I have had for 10 years........they last a good long while. Highly recommend!
Once again something I couldn't find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2 so I have a back up, nothing worse than your old hair dryer going on the fritz half way thru the job and no back back up, talk about bad hair day. Shipper got them to me quickly.
i love this new blowdryer, it's just as it described and was a very good price. i got it on time, too !
This is a fantastic littler hair dryer.  Despite the small size, it still gets quite warm and blows a good stream of air on high.  While my hair is fairly short so perhaps this isn't saying much, it does dry it off quite quickly.  The small size is also a plus as it makes it perfect for traveling.  If you're looking for a hair dryer with attachments, you'll need to look elsewhere.  But if you want a good, compact hair dryer, look no further.
Bought it because I've always liked the ones in the hotel rooms.  Has good power and lightweight.  Helps to organize my bathroom.
Both my daughter and myself were looking for a dryer that didn't go in the drawer.  I read all the reviews and choose this one.<br /><br />I really like the simplicity of the dryer.  It dries my hair with ease and I have thick and long hair.<br /><br />The only drawback to this dryer is the length of the cord.  Make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top.
What a great item.  So much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels!  Works great and has the ideal settings for my needs.
Perfect size, for home or travel.  It's not too small or too bulky or large.  It puts out the perfect amount of heat and air.
We used to buy the more expensive name brand hair products.  After reading reviews of this dryer, we decided to try it.  There are three girls in my family and we all use and love this dryer!
this is just the right size and weight. I have a lot of trouble with my wrist and this dryer handles so nice. Also it does not take up much space at all.
I bought this blowdryer in 2004 and it always made my hair silky and shiny. This one which is advertised as the same exact thing doesn't work the same. My hair is always looking dry and burnt. I wouldn't recommend buying this blowdryer. It is the same as any cheap blowdryer you can buy at Cvs.
This dries my hair so much faster than my old hair dryer. It gets hot enough but not to hot and I love that you can change the temp settings on it. The cool blast button also works very good. The cord is long enough and it is not to loud. Doesn't seem to dry my hair out and make it frizzy at all either. Would definitely buy again, very pleased.
Works great! It does exactly what it says & It came with all the attachments in the pic. I love it!
My last blow dryer was a Remington and it lasted for well over 10 years. That is the reason I purchased this one. I looked at cheaper ones but kept coming back to this when it arrived I was not disappointed. It had all the features I wanted plus it feels sturdy in my hand not fragile like one drop and it's over. Also it drys quickly  and isn't terribly noisy.  If this one lasts half as long as my last one I will be a very pleased customer. Like I said I love it.
I used this brand of hairdryer for the first time during a recent hotel stay, and I just loved it.  It's light, fast, and easy to use.  The buttons are also conveniently placed so that my hand is not on them as I use the dryer.  I liked the dryer in the hotel so much that I immediately ordered one.  It's a super dryer, just about the best I've ever used.
This dryer just feels like a quality build. After a week of use, I will say that it performs way beyond what I expected. While I have relatively short hair and this dryer gets the job done in about one-fourth of the time my old dryer did. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it.
&#34;...more than you can afford pal.&#34; is not a phrase you should apply here. It's quieter, blows harder, has ionizer or maybe a deionizer, it's red, has an awesome cord.<br /><br />And did I mention its very quiet? Has more of a whooooooooosh shound than typical shrill hair dryer, &#34;Wheeeeeeee-zzzzzzzzzzzz-eeeeee-zzzzzz-eeee-hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ddrrrrrrrrrrrrr-wheeeeeeeeesh&#34;
Super awesome.  Dries my hair in no time.  Makes it shine and the style lasts for several days. Very good.
I bought this dryer to make it easier to do both my daughters hair and to teach them how to dry their hair on the type of dryer I learned on.  Wonderful purchase the price was great and this dryer dries hair so much faster than my old model.  Would buy again
Just what my wife wanted for the bath room. Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror. Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.
This is an awesome blow drier.  I'm going to buy it and give it to my girlfriends for gifts, you really can't beat the price for the quality you get.  I first tried it in an upscale day spa in Chicago.  I had to call the place to find out the brand and model because that was the best hair day of my life to date.  Now my hair is shiny and frizz-free every day.  I couldn't be happier.
This dryer never fails me. It does a great job every time. It gets super hot, which can be dangerous.
I love this hair dryer.  Long cord and great power drying. Drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it. Hair looks great after.
I like it. It's working very well. Like the heat a lot, get things done faster. It's strong too. Definitely a good deal.
This hair dryer was perfect for my needs, and the pricing didn't hurt anything either! I am MORE than satisfied! 2 thumbs up all around!
The bonnet hair dryer is fabulousðŸ’.  It's so lightweight.  I can dry my curls and read a book in ease. Absolutely love it.
I love the automatic on/off feature when you use the dryer.  Powerful enough for my short hair.  Would purchase again.
I have a lot of hair. It's waist length, and thick. I used a plastic Conair Ion Shine 1875 hair dryer prior to buying this one. I could dry my hair with the Conair in maybe 15-20min. With the Remington, I can dry my hair in 5-10min! As for the less frizz the pearl ceramic plate is supposed to deliver, I think my hair is less frizzier... I have no idea if this is because of that, or because this dryer can sustain heat and air flow well enough to straighten my hair better.<br /><br />The colors are a bit off from the product image. The removable cap on the back of the dryer is a darker shade of pink, while the buttons and the ceramic plate are a lighter pink (but the product image's pink is a lot lighter). The unit itself is a dark maroon or purple-ish sort of color. It's not black. The material is not plastic. It has an interesting finish... smooth but doesn't slide around on a marble countertop like plastic does). The entire hairdryer is a bit heavier than I'm used to, but it's not too much of a big deal as long as you keep your hairdryer steady and you don't swing it about. Since it dries my hair in just a few minutes, the weight really isn't an issue. The cord is a decent length, but I use this at the sink, so I don't need a very long cord.<br /><br />I like the extra heat so I always have my heat set to the third level. The second level is probably better for finer hair. My hair is thick, so I like more heat. The first level is only slightly warm. It's just slightly warmer than the cold shot setting.<br /><br />As for the air speeds... I also like to use the highest setting. The second highest setting is just as fine, but if I'm in a rush, I blast the settings to dry my hair quickly. The air flow is very strong, so with finer hair, you're probably better off at a lower setting here as well. I noticed that other reviews have said they actually keep the hairdryer about 8in from their head to avoid burns. Just to give you a better understanding of my hair, I use the highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in. So much hair, and I like it long.<br /><br />Overall, hairdryer is heavy, but the heat and the air speed is fantastic for anyone with a lot of hair that's thick and long. Saves me time in the morning when getting ready, and my hair isn't as frizzy. Bonus points: After placing my order, I received this unit the next morning. I'm impressed with the Prime shipping speed with this one.highest settings for both heat and speed, and I place this a lot closer to my head than 8in.

I needed a good hair dryer bad!  I ordered this not really knowing it had a retractable cord.  What an awesome idea!  Just love it.
I love this item!!!! Not only is pink my favorite color but one of my close friends is fighting cancer, so it serves 2 purposes but it also work great!!!! thank u!!!!
This is the second one I've purchased (still using the first one which I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond).  I like its features so much that I bought this second one as a back-up in case the first one quits, but it's still going strong at about five years old.
I received the Hair Dryer today.  I used it on my daughters hair and it worked just as promised.  I am African American and this is the first hair dryer that I have purchased that has actually lived up to its claims.  My daughter has thick hair and this dryer literally cut the drying time in half.  The handle is comfortable to hold and the attachments work perfectly.  Also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times.  It gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine.
I had my reservations before I bought this, but I am so glad I did! It is small enough to travel with and has loads of power to dry even the thickest head of hair. Great purchase!!
My conair hair dryer decided to bite the dust on me and the following day I was having a medical procedure done.  I was pressed for time so I ordered this one and have one day shipping.  I must say that I love this hairdryer.  It is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online.  It is not too heavy and comes with two extensions.  I love the choices between low, medium and high and also low, warm, hot and cool.  I highly recommend this item.  It is not too noisy either.
Haven't used it yet. The packaging is great and compare to the price I have seen for the same make and model it is good.
This hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth. Drys my hair quickly. Love the retractable cord.
I have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel.  Lightweight and a good airflow!
I really like this dryer and am enjoying using it.  My other one had bit the dust after about 7 years.
I love this hair dryer!  It is very quiet compared to many dryers I have had.  It is awesome having so many heat and speed settings.  It comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn't really need them. The retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer.  I would definitely buy again. The only con I can find is that it is a little heavier them I am use it.
I researched various black on-wall hairdryers and I liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way. I mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer, but it's actually come in handy for me as well. Anyway, mount and forget this thing. The cord for how I mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit, but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit. After two-years, it's still working great and gets a decent amount of use. No problems whatsoever.
I use this every day and it is a good reliable product but the power switch has started to stick.  I think that a shot of WD-40 would fix it, though.  I have been using it for many years and like the product.  I would buy another and recommend it highly to others.
I not always that I would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one. It does wonders with my daughters very natural hair. I love it and would recommend it to everyone.
Excellent hair dryer for a low price;  I have 2 of these dryers;  They easily fit into a gym bag, get the job done and is very simple to operate;  You can't go wrong with this dryer
The first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working. I really love the retractable cord, prevents clutter.
It's amazing you don't know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one! This hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others.  My old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin, fine hair. This one only took 5 min! Love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel.  Works great!
It worked fine on my trip to Israel.  It is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power.
I have had many blow dryers......... then of course I needed another one, so<br />instead of going to Target again, I thought let me see whats out there.... I love Amazon so<br />that was the first place I went to. I saw this blow dryer and read the reviews and thought, let me give this<br />a  try (because of the revew) and I just LOVE, LOVE this blow dryer.
Great hair dryer....super quiet..and dries hair quickly.... it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well
I ordered this Hair Dryer for my wife.  Shipping was right on the money and packaged superbly with no damage.<br />My wife loves it.  If she loves it then I plumb tickled!
This was a gift to my Mrs.<br />Decent dryer.<br />All the features of her expiring one.<br />Very good price.<br />Arrived on time for Christmas.<br />Excellent packing and shipping.<br />Runs every day without a blip.
This hair dryer is awesome. Dries my hair in 10 min. and leaves it smooth! Other dryers I've tried either overheat before I'm done drying, or take at least double the time.<br /><br />I actually had to order one for my mother after she tried mine.
Dries my hair fast and love the cool shot button. What I don't like is that it has a big square plug.
I used the blow dryer for the first time tonight and I love love love it! For one it is pretty and it has different temperatures you can choose from, and different air speeds. My hair is really frizzy, and the blow dryer helped to de-frizz my hair. Love it!!
I take this hair dryer to the gym with me in my gym bag.  It fits perfectly, and has my short hair dry in no time.  It also gives my hair some volume (I use the diffuser).  It's sturdy, and I'm very pleased with it.
This hair dryer is a life saver!  I have long, thick, curly, frizzy hair, and this product is the cure all!  Takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry and style my hair.  My hair dresser recommended this product,and she was spot on! Highly recommended!
It is unique and portable. I love the style, the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly. I would recommend it to everyone who needs a blow dryer. Thank you
This is a good ceramic hair dryer for the money.  The retractable cord is a bonus.  Don't expect a $20 dryer to last forever so treat it gently and it will last a long time.
Exactly what I was looking for.....as it is only used when traveling and hair is short.  Light weight and folds neatly.
It gets my long hair dry in record time without drying it out!!  I love the cool down button as well.
Really like the hair blower. makes my hair feel soft and silky..its a little heavy but it dries your hair fast do its no problem
Dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition.<br />It needs less about half time than other hair dryer.<br />And the hair is smooth without any damage.<br />It is an impressive product.<br /><br />Cons is the weight. It is heavier than other brands.<br />However I don't have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick, hence the weight is not too big an issue to me.
And she just loves it.  Not only does she like Hello Kitty, but pink is her &#34;very mostest favoritest color in the whole world&#34; as she puts it.
Mine was getting quite old and cranky and I decided time for a new one, this has hot and cold setting, great power and is not terribly noisy.
My husband and I got tired of having a blow dryer that either took up space on the counter or got pulled off the counter every time the drawer opened.  I ordered this and he mounted it on the wall under a towel rack.  We use the dryer and then place it back and it is very inconspicuous.
Great quality, easy to use, heats up fast with lots of power. It's well worth the money invested when you need to replace your outdated blow dryer.
It worked well for me, since I use it everyday. No complaints on this product.  Easy to use and handle
Works well so far! I thought I'd give it a try since it was a fairly low price. It was bigger than I thought it would be. So if you're looking for something to travel with, this might be a bit too big. Other than that, this is a really good deal
Love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying and I can finally watch tv thank you
My daughter wanted an drier with a air disperser on it. This was exactly what they she wanted. The drier works exactly as stated. The only issue is it's bulking too bad you can't fold it.
Another successful product.
I had always wanted a Ceramic Blow Dryer.  Leaves my hair smoother and less flyaways.  Great product for the money.
The 2000 watts gives it the blowing power needed as well as generous air intake that doesn't stifle it's power.  The heating element is placed far enough back so the hair doesn't get burnt.  Tough - I've dropped mine several times and it's still up 40 blow dries a week. This one has been in daily service for a year and probably won't break on it's own ... leave that up to me - my favorite dryer for the past 12 years.
Let's face it, I'm a guy.  I use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when I get out of the shower.  I don't need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements, I don't need salon-duty roller bearings, I don't need a pink gemstone-encrusted handle.<br /><br />I need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch, and this model does it.  Works fine, without all the bells, whistles, and gee-gaws, and without breaking the bank.  Oh and it's blue.  A good guy color.
Great heat and strength controls.  Great handling to style hair.  I have had numerous Conair hair dryers over my lifetime and will continue to purchase them due to ther great quality.
My wife used this hair dryer at the Heathman Hotel in Portland and had to buy them for our VRBO  in Bend Or. Our VRBO 304450 incase you want to try the hair dryers!!!
This is the second one I have purchased and will continue to buy product as long as they make it.  Love that it hangs on the wall, the shape of it makes it easy to hold.
thanks to this hairdryer. Lots of air, variable temperature, light weight too. Every feature I want and need. Great price too.
I installed these in the bathrooms of our house.  No more hairdryers on the counters, tangled cords, etc.  No replacing the portable units every year.  Only wish is I had done this 10 years ago.
This thing really pack a punch. Perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn't too great on the head and hair. This thing isn't slim but not too big nor too heavy. My just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy.<br /><br />From out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non-ceramic ones. But since we mainly use it to dry rather than style, I'm not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic. There is only one rocker button for cool / turbo. The other buttons are large slide buttons so you can't accidentally change the settings. The finish is quality hard glossy plastic. I will not buy non-slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time.<br /><br />So far so good for a couple of months. But I think they realized that they made a big mistake by not marketing it only to salons, with a price to match. I would love to have another one to replace my daughter's broken one but now it sells for 10 times the price I paid.
Great Product! I would recommend for anyone. I had no issues with it, and it does it does fight the frizz! have been through so many blowdryers and I have to say this is the best blowdryer I have ever owned.
Inexpensive and does exactly what you need it to...my hair is about shoulder length and it dries it within about five minutes which is great! It can be loud on the higher setting but most hair dryers are. I recommend it!
My old ionic dryer was dying- I liked that this one featured an &#34;on demand&#34; ion option, and other reviewers vouched for its quiet. I am using it now for a few months, and it is really a great dryer.  It is light, balanced, and easy to handle.  I like that you can switch the ion on/off, and that heat/air settings are completely adjustable.  And it really, really is quiet. It does what is says it does, and it is worth the $$.  Also shipped quickly. Makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly.
I bought this for my family and we all just love it!  The cord is a little on the shorter side, but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast! Worth the $.
Love the hair dryer--easy to carry and take with me on the go. Great so far. Really like it a lot.
Use it at home as your &#34;go to&#34; hairdryer or bring it with you on trips.  So light & easy with lots of power.  Love the color too!
This Blow dryer is SUPER  I would really recommend it to anybody looking for a blow dryer,  Thank YOU  Diane Heuring
This is a very nice dryer.  I had one and when my daughter in law used it, she wanted one too.  We are both very satisfied.
Great product.  Dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year.  Attachments weren't in box and merchant had excellent customer service.  Would buy again product from merchant again.  Very happy.  Healthier hair.
Love this dryer! Pretty color and I am absolutely digging the retractable cord! Works perfectly! I read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord but I found it to be more than long enough for me. Im not sure why you would need it any longer. Very satisfied customer!
I would definitely recommend I am African American and my hair is natural. This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.
I buy cheap. I don't need anything fancy, just something that gets the job done. This works great! Gets at right temperature comes with attachments. It's better than a $30 one my sister bought.
I love my bed head !!!!!!! This hair dryer does what it says,works great. Gets hot. I did notice that it does make my hair shiny. Great find at an awesome price.
I ordered this dryer to replace a &#34;Vidal Sassoon&#34; branded hot comb/dryer that had served me well for many years.  I wanted it because I really like the &#34;hot comb&#34; style.  After receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit I would bet that Andis manufactured the dryer for Vidal Sassoon.  Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.
This hair dryer is light, but powerful.  It dries my hair quickly but doesn't dry it out.  I'm very happy with it.
I don't use a blow dryer often, but with a new short cut I found I needed to- this blow dryer does wonders in a short time with my curls.... I use the diffuser attachment that came with it.  Super.
Love the weight and size - but mainly I have naturally curly hair so was very happy w the diffuser.
I would highly recommend this dryer. It frees up space on my counter since it is a hang-up, and yet has great blowing power. And the night light is a great plus! No need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space (there is never enough outlets in a bathroom).
Even though this is a &#34;professional&#34; style pistol hair dryer it's not  full sized  (it's medium sized).<br />It's best suited for shorter hair styles, otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it's 1600 wattage (but it's still pretty powerful for a medium dryer).<br />It's light weigh and has a matte finish.
it does everything a good dryer should do.  The retractable cord doesn't work as well as it should unfortunately but can be managed.
Fast drying with lots of shine - I was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5-star hotel I stayed at - it dries hair fast with lots of shine.
Good, Handy. Easy to use. Small enough to put in suitcase when traveling. Takes up very little space when storing..
This just arrived and I've used it only once but my first impression was good.  It dried my hair (which has natural waves and can be difficult to dry/style) quickly and seemed more powerful than my last one.
It is really powerful, my wife love it! It dries real fast your hair and the price is excellent! Recommended!
Had surgery on my hand so I needed something light weight, yet powerful enough to dry my very long thick hair. Took a chance and was surprised that the dryer was both ! Excellent price as well. I am buying another one for my daughter in law.
This hair dryer is everything that I could have expected. The diffuser is perfect for my curly hair. It dries quickly and efficiently. Plus, I love the controls. I'm 61, and my hair has become quite thin. This dryer really volumizes and gives my hair the perfect curl. A MUST buy.
Pretty good hair dryer my dad inlaw sometimes  uses it to dry his clothes if that means anything and it hasn't burnt out yet.
Lots of settings, strong air flow, there's not much to dislike about this. The nozzle (?) is a bit long, making it slightly unwieldy, but other than that it's fantastic.
It is exactly what I needed! It dries and smooths my long, wavy, curly hair. Also very easy to handle.
I didn't fully appreciate this dryer until I broke it and I was without it for a few days.  It dries fast and gets really hot. Extra help is its long cord. I don't have the frizz like I had before. Watch Carley Babel on YouTube on how to blow out your hair, she is such a help.
I have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers, and this one is by far the best I've ever used.
This is my second one of these each of my daughters wanted one.  My daughters and their mother say they get great results everytime.
This was a gift to my Daughter. Loves the pink color, works great she has used the hair dryer everyday since she has received it.
I am able to dry my hair faster, this dryer is simple, powerful and it's easy to handle! Love it!
I just got me new blow dryer and I LOVE it. It is so quite and it dry's my hair in half the time of my old one, I also love that the cord winds right up.
A blow dyrer that gets the job done. I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat. The Andis 1875 Watt provided that and what would normally take about 30 minutes only took 15.  The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable. I dropped it on the floor twice before using it and it remained intact.  I will say the dryer is on the heavy side but I didn't care because I'd finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer.
Similar to some reviewers, initially I became fond of this specific type of hair dryer when I was lodging in a hotel. The hair dryer has several combinations of blowing temperature and speed. I like the fact that its lowest wind level is low enough, unlike some of the hair dryers on the market which are way too power even set on the lowest switch. I found this item on amazon and the price is unbeatable. Recommend.
I think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer.  It is just the perfect size and the folding handle is great.  I looked a long time for a good brand, reliable compact dryer with a folding handle.  So glad I spotted this one on Amazon.  This dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair.
Great Dryer with a lot of power.  Quick drying hair.  I love it and would recommend to anyone.  Very satisfied.
This is a great hair blower and I can't believe how good it is for the price!  Don't know why one would get a more expensive one.
This hair dryer is not very big which is just fine with me. I am a short person with small hands so it fits comfortably in my hand and it is also light weight.  Vivid dark pink with 2 attachments that I use a lot. The auto cord reel is genius!!! A bonus.
This thing is SO fantastic, seriously. I'm tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before I need a new one. It dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than I've ever experienced from a dryer. I'm notorious for showering at night simply so that I don't have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings, but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick, simple thing. The retractable cord is a huge plus, the folding neck is a plus, I really just can't say enough good things about this dryer. Especially for the price! BUY IT.
This dryer is average size nothing compact about it.. And it's not as warm as my normal one but it does fold up and I love the cord I usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair so I turn it down to med.
Great power and portability! Size is not too small or too large.  I would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer.
After going on vacation and this blow dryer being in my hotel room, I found out which model it was and immediately bought it online! It is the best hair blow dryer I have ever owned, I love it still going strong 2 years later. I am Samoan, I have a lot of hair and it gets done in less than 10 minutes. Thank you!!
I was looking for a hair dryer that was cheaper, but made well. This has fit the bill. I'm a guy and decided I could manage my hair a few ways with a hairdryer, if I chose. I didn't want to burn my hair out or have something too feminine or fancy sitting in my bathroom closet. This is simple and sleek. It sounds like a hair dryer.
this is a super blow dry I ever see,<br />its fast and strong,save a lot of time to dry my client hair<br />I wish they could made this blow dry a featherweight in the fulture<br />thanks
I have very curly, color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser. This dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments. I usually let my hair air dry, which can take 2 hours! With the dryer, I put it on cool for about 25-30 minutes while I return emails, and I'm good to go! I like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials. Shipping was very fast! I've used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks, and so far so good!
Works really good.. Thought it was bigger though.. It has a small nozzle. But it definitely gets the job done.
Very good! I use it everyday, and it has worked very well for 5 months. The price is attractive! The protective switch is convenient.
I was in need of a new hair dryer after mine broke and I discovered that they don't make it anymore. I purchased a hairdryer at a local beauty supply chain, thinking that it would work about as well as my dearly departed one. Wrong! It left my hair feeling very dry, in spite of the product I use on my hair prior to blowing it dry. I was going to invest in a CHI, but after reading mostly negative reviews on that model, I decided to save my money and get this Andis hair dryer. I have very thick, coarse, long hair (4 inches past my shoulders), and I'm transitioning from relaxer to natural. I have about 3-4 inches of new growth, and the rest is still relaxed, so straighter styles work for the time being. This hair dryer is EVERYTHING! Not only was it easy on the wallet, it gets my hair dry super quickly, while not sucking all of the moisture out of my hair. It takes less than 20 minutes to dry my hair, which is quicker than even my original blow dryer, and gets my roots pretty straight (I use the small tooth comb attachment). It's easy to hold and gets hot without burning my scalp. Coupled with my Sedu flat iron, my hair is almost salon quality, super soft and shiny! I would recommend this to anyone with the same hair texture as me. I am VERY pleased!
Just what we were looking for . Compact light and functional. Haven't used it yet but seems to be what I wanted.  Good quality of manufacture, just what the Dr. ordered.
Lets just say...I no longer need to go to the hair salon to get my hair done. It dries your hair super fast and its not heavy to use.<br />In the beginning I had to get use to using it but  after a few tries I mastered blowing out my hair just like they do in the hair salon. I highly recommended!!!
I defrost my freezer with it, I thawed out my car doors with itr.  I live in a humid part of the country where a towel doesn't quite get the job done so I use it for that.  I even dey my hair with it
It's is awesome, made my life easier and I don't have to go to the parlor every week as I was doing before. I have curly hair, with this product Im able to blow dryer well and style with my flat iron. The only negative about it  is the little attachable brush, not good quality, I used once and its gone, needs a replacement. The combs are fine!<br />Overall I recommend the product, It was a great addition.<br />Rose Rosa
This hair dryer works great for me and the price is very reasonable. It also More than met my expectations.
The dryer is light weight and full of options.  I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..
I have been happily using this dryer for 8 years - best dryer I have ever purchased and no indication that it won't be going strong 8 years from now
I've using this dryer for 2 months and decided to get one for my sis and my mom too. It's different than the regular dryer cuz it comes w/ multi-functions. You can choose &#34;scalp mode&#34; for sensitive scalp and &#34;skin mode&#34; when applying face mask. Its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it!!
I didn't realize it included the retractable cord. It works great. The folding handle is also a plus. Also good power
I bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since I enjoy this hair dryer so much. What I love about it most is the retractable cord--awesome invention. I also like that you can remove and clean the filter. Noise level is standard for a hair dryer, maybe even slightly quieter than average. My only criticism is that it is the heaviest hair dryer I have owned. So glad I bought this and not a super cheap one.
Bang for the buck. Bought this for my wife, since she was struggling with a spaced out hair dryer that she's been using for many years. This worked perfectly, would recommend for anyone who doesn't like a change, although it long overdue. Lives up to the expectations
I first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair. In the morning, I don't want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before I leave. I want some time to style, too.<br /><br />This hair dryer has a professional quality motor (1875 watt AC motor) which translates to stronger air flow, hotter air, and less drying time. That's exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. This hairdryer, with the airflow concentrator attachment, dried my hair in under 7 minutes, which is unheard of for me. It has 3 heat settings, 2 fan speeds, and a cool air shot button.<br /><br />BONUS: This hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others I've owned. It's still a hair dryer, so it'll make noise, but this one's noises are hushed.<br /><br />Besides its speedy drying, it's just a really pretty hair dryer. It's got an attractive black matte finish that's soft to the touch. It also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet, yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine.
I had this same hair dryer for over ten years before it stopped working, so I replaced it with the same model!  I only wish there were more color options, but for the quality the price can't be beat!
Best Hairdryer going. Big powerfull, lasts yaears and years.<br /><br />This is about teh third one I have purchased and I hope they keep making them..
Easy to install and use. Did whish they came in diferent colors.Would reccomend to use in any bathroom. I think I might get one for my shop. to heat materials prior to gluing.<br />Skip Kempf
Loved this.  Big enough for the rollers and I have long, thick hair.  Hot enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time.
Own this for a while. No problems so far. Worked as well as it did on the first day I purchased it. Some nice features for the money
This hair dryer will take the abuse of flying 20' through the air and smashing me in the head! Very durable and she likes the retracting cord!
Excelent<br /><br />terrible Tommy Hilfiger Men's 4 Pack Boxer Brief, Red/Navy/White, Large<br />Tommy Hilfiger<br />How does this product fit?  ffffffffffffffffweryt3r veqtwrvrv qr3
Bought this as stocking stuffer and daughters luv luv it.  Great gift and actually has removable lint screen which a lot of blow dryers don't have.  Will buy another one soon because 1 blow dryer for 2 girls doesn't quite do it!!!  Lol
Powerful dryer and easy to install, at a good price.  Keeps the cord off the counter and frees up counter space.
This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  My wife couldn't live without it.
So convenient, seems to work just fine, had it for a month so far. Easy to install and looks great too.
it's a little heavy but it's well made and easy to use.<br />I like the smooth feeling of the surface.<br />wish it was a little bit smaller/lighter.
Bought this for my elderly mother, whose old hairdryer was heavy and bulky. She loves this one, it's light and much easier for a handicapped person to use.
This dryer dries my long hair quickly and efficiently.  I even notice less frizz than I used to, which is fantastic.
The hair dryer is tiny, yet powerful. It has two speeds and and attachment to extend the dryer. Build quality appears to be similar to big brand name hair dryers.
Very convenient and easy to setup. Everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow. I would definitely recommend especially as an investment to save money.
No sales puffing with this product.  It performs exactly as marketed and fits into small spaces.  The retractable cord was a selling point for me, and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly.  I would have no reservation recommending this unit.
I don't know what I'll think in six months if the dryer konks out on me.  But for now, I couldn't be happier.  I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  Anyway, I'm very pleased, and the price was excellent.
I was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores.<br /><br />I was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50% less than other retailers and websites.<br /><br />Works great and does not take up additional counter top in bathroom.
Compact, easy to hang and reliable. Very powerful for the size. Would recommend this to anyone needing a small hair dryer.
I love this hair dryer. It's fast at drying and quiet. It's a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money. I also bought the hair straightner and it's just as good. I hope Onei keeps making great products like Chi use too!
I love the power this dryer has.  Cuts drying time by a third.  Nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell.  Does not perform like a travel dryer - excellent.
I recommend it ,is a very good product.i only work with the best ,it worth the money ,I'm going to buy three more.
This is light, quiet, effective, several options for heat and speed settings.  Everything you need. Top rated by consumer reports.
I oove it!  Works great, plenty of blow power and love the added bonus of the night light. I would recommend this product for purchase.
I used this powerful, 1875 Watts, Dual Voltage 125/250 blower in Cuba last week, along with a separate plug adaptor. It worked perfectly, just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife (or other instrument) to 250V setting, and use on high or low settings.<br />This is a great product for me, I don't like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the US (you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on) because it's awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand. Also, the diffuser is high quality with twelve prongs.<br />It's not exactly tiny in size once it's open, but is slightly smaller than my regular blower, and it's great the handle folds.<br /><br />When travelling, it's the small conveniences that make me happy, and this blower did just that!
My wife requested it because she already had one at our 1st home and wanted one just like it for our 2nd home.
The first time I used it I saw the difference with my hair. My hair was softer and less frizzy.<br />But I still find it expensive.
I have purchased two of these blow dryers, one for myself and the other as a gift. The HSI works well, dries hair quickly, the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other I have purchased. I have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer, a Babyliss Pro. Both of us are happy with the HSI. I would purchase again.
This dryer is lightweight by very powerful.  It dries my hair very fast on a low setting so I have less breakage.
Best hair dryer ever! My hair has been so easy to manage with it especially with my very very thick hair.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone.
This hairdryer is working out well for me. It is hard for me to believe that the ionic conditioning feature really works but it really seems to!  My hair has less static in it after I use this dryer on it. This winter has seemed unusually static filled so this is a welcome relief.
This hair dryer is awesome!! It doesn't get too hot and dries my hair very nicely and was exactly what I was looking for!! Very pleased!!!
I like it because it is not a noisy hair dryer. It works fine and does have a comfort touch.
I have bought two of these (one to keep at my boyfriend's place too). They pack well and are wonderful. Very convenient for travel, and dry my hair very quickly.
This was my favorite blow dryer. I had it for a few years and then it died on me. I couldn't find it in the stores anymore so I turned to Amazon. Yay! Got my fav dryer back and it works perfectly :)
I have had this hair dryer every day for a long time and it is the best. I use it with the nice difusser that comes with it and my hair has beautiful curls.  I would highly recommend it for people that want to have pretty soft curls when using a difusser. I do not use it for anything else. I have had people borrow it to dry straight hair and they say it is great.
Reasonably priced and powerful, one of the best in the same class, impressed with the separate control of speed and temp for this price
I did a lot of research. This is the narrowest one. The 2 speed 3 heat settings are great. Very nice for a small space.
It's great!! It's kinda loud but a great product!! Would buy another. Loved the red! The cord goes back up the dryer. Loved that feature.
Does everything I need it to do. Light and easy to use. I love  the attachments too. Dries nicely and fast.
I have medium length, fine curly hair and needed a low setting and warm air and good diffuser that won't sit right on your hair...check, check and check. Perfect for drying while not blowing your hair around so to break the curl or cause frizz. And it's lightweight..a real gem.
This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  It dries great and doesn't make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have.
I had no idea how cheap my hair dryer was till I used this one. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and tried it. It worked great! I liked hers so much I bought one for myself.
Really like this hair dryer.  Does not frizz hair when drying. Can be used with or without several dryer attachments. Like all silver color.  Controls are well placed and very easy to use.  Has really long cord which helps.  A little heavy (but I'm in my sixties) but its weight not a real problem.  Hangs up easily when not in use. Highly recommend this hair dryer.  Price reflects quality, value and great find!
The style looks sheik hanging on wall. Looks good and very quiet. I like the nite light that's built into it.
Our blow dryer died recently. Panic!! But we just didn't have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we'd had for so long. I took a chance and looked on Amazon and there it was ... the exact one we wanted! It has a lot of power and we're very pleased with it.
So far so good!! I've had it a few weeks now and it's still working good. Blowing really hot. Quick dry time.
I love this blow dryer for a couple of reasons:<br /><br />1.  It has a super long cord which is awesome<br />2.  It had not only high and low but you can adjust the heat level as well.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like as well:<br /><br />1.  It is a little heavy but nothing that would sway me from buying again<br />2.  The buttons are in a bad spot and I occasionally bump them.<br /><br />I would definately recommend.
Dryer is Great for the money, It is quiet gets hot and seems to compare to the Chi dryer we also have in the salon. Thank you so much. the final test will be life span.
Dries my thick hair very quickly. It makes quick work of straightening my hair while blow drying. Leaves my hair shiny. It's an awesome dryer.
I have very thick hair. This hair dryer works amazingly. And it's really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size. I love it and will absolutely buy again.
Dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it's portable.  I also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair-drying environment.  However, that's just my opinion; I don't have anything to prove that.  The only negative that I have relative to bonnet style dryer is -- from experience -- the bonnet wears/tears up before the dryer breaks and I haven't been able to get replacement bonnets.
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM<br />SHE SEARCHED ON-LINE AND FOUND THIS ONE<br />IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR<br />WORKS GREAT
It dries my hair so fast!  I love it and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good hair dryer at a low price.
Like it. Simple, with strong wind power that could dry my hair in a short time, and the price is terrific!
This dryer works great and has a lot of power. For $10.00?!? You can't beat that!  It's also a  bit smaller than most dryers so it's easy to hold and maneuver.
this hair dryer is the great things that can use the less time to make my long hair dry. I love it
Best hair dryer ever. Super high power. I dunno if it has something to do with the &#34;ionize&#34; part , but it actually thickens up my hair. I'm 46 and it's getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair. Can't go wrong with this one.
I have very fine hair that doesn't like to be styled. Using this dryer, I have;<br /><br />Volume<br />Body<br />Curl<br /><br />AND, I don't have to use any product to get it that way. I believe the key is not only the dryer, but, the shampoo you use. I use a Keratin infused shampoo with Ion ultra light weight conditioner. Bottom line- this blow dryer is incredible!
This is great for a smaller bathroom - like I have - and it mounted easily on the wall and I use it daily,
I love this hair dryer. It is a bit heavier than my previous one but my hair dreys faster so I don't mind.  The air blows really hot if you use the highest setting so it took a bit getting used to it, but I love it
This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)â€¦so I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. Butâ€¦I still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot. I'm thrilled with mine.r / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days.

So far it is all that it promised works well, and is very compacted would I recommend it Yes.. very pleased...
This works great and has really helped cut down on my static! Also-my hair feels SO MUCH better now that I am not using my cheapie blow dryer!
After using the Onei flat iron I decided to see what other Onei products I could purchase. This blow dryer is fabulous. I have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power, my blow dry time has been shortened. Every time I use this dryer i feel like I am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line. No more blow dry bars for me. I am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the Onei Hair dryer.
Can't beat it for the price! Has all the options you need. I would recommend to anyone. Also like that it's fairly quiet.
IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE.  A GREAT WEIGHT.  RETRACTABLE!  THE HANDLE FOLDS & IT DRYS VERY WELL!  BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!  AFTER READING SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS I WAS RELUCTANT TO BUY IT BUT I'M SURE GLAD I DID!
i'm a big world traveller & this is the best one i've used. small & lightweight. seemed about right the right price.
I can't find this at my local store anymore and I just love it... so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup.  Works well and seems to last a long time. Have had about 4 of them so far over the years ... wouldn't use anything else if i can help it.
the Conair 1875 Watt Turbo Styler with Ionic Conditioning is quite strong... also the price is nice. So I really like it
This Hair Dryer Folds Up Nicely, The Cord Retracts Smoothly & The Settings Are Also Perfect And Do Not Burn My Hair.
love this hair dryer! perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing!
Works as promised! I also looked at it and thought I had received a toy hairdryer- but it works works works! I took it with me on my trip to WA and all three family members used it daily. It is quick! It does not cause fizz or flyaways. The attachments are plastic-but for the price it works wonderfully. Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-) PS: The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)
I've only used this dryer for a few weeks, but so far so good. I have long thick hair and only need to use medium speed on medium heat to get everything dry in 10 minutes. The ongoing polar vortex combined with my own bleary negligence every morning is a pretty good litmus test for any product, but I've only gotten my hair stuck in it once and it's not so hot I've damaged my hair. When all is said and done, I'm fairly impressed. With the dryer; not myself.
Love the travel hair dryer. It folds down to take up less place. The diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot/cold air options.
Can't believe how small and yet powerful this little thing is!  Best travel hairdryer ever thanks to the ultra compact size and low wattage.  Will be perfect for our trip to Europe.  Wife used it a few times to see how it worked and she is &#34;blown away&#34; (excuse the bad pun).  It really is all you could want in a travel sized hair dryer and you won't believe how small it is, but don't let that scare you away!
I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair fast, and makes my hair very shiny and straight.  I used to use Revlon hair drier from drug store which is about $15.  Revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy.  This Panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for.  It's worth it.  The finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer. I feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this.  I highly recommend this product.
I love this brand and model of hairdryer. I had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years, and it was the most durable hairdryer I've ever had. I would say this one was not as hot as my last, but still a very decent hairdryer. I would definitely recommend!
I find it very handy for my daily hair drying. My grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair.
This hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth. I always tried to avoid any hair dryer, because they all made my hair frizzier. This hair dryer got my attention in the store, so I went on line at Amazon, found good reviews and good price and I bought it. I couldnâ€™t believe, when I got such a nice result after the first time I used it. I am using right now for 2 months and I am still happy with it. No regrets.
I buy one of these wall mount dryers every time my old dryer is exhausted.<br />I use it everyday and it lasts a long time before replacing it.  I am pleased<br />with its durability.
I really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought. These things are disposable and at this price that makes that part more than acceptable.
I love it. I really do.  What more can I say? I mounted it on the wall and have used it since I got it. Thank you!
I love this blow dryer. I wanted one I didn't have to put away every day or have lying around with the cord all bunched up. This fit the bill perfectly. It's on the wall, out of the way and always ready.
This is my second vidal sassoon dryer.<br />I bought a second one for travel.<br />I like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings.<br />I may just get another for future use.
Saw this at first in a great hotel and ordered right when I got home.  love the wattage , the look,<br />the compactness and easy storage!!!!!
Does exactly what it needs to do. Solid and durable. Gets so hot makes you wanna smack yo mama. Buy it.
I had an Andis Hair Dryer for at least 8 years until it died on me recently.<br />The replacement is wonderful; product still as reliable as it was before!
Very powerful and dries hair fast!  I purchased this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.  The wall mount is very handy so it doesn't need rolled up every day like traditional ones.
I was hesitant to buy ths hair dryer because its only 1875 watts, i started to buy a 2000 watt dryer, but chose this one instead......I have shoulder length hair and this hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes,  I love the color and also the fact that it has different heat settings and speeds,  so glad I purchased it
I also use this hair dryer.  I like it better than the 1 we originally had, but my daughter doesn't think it puts out as much air.  So since I'm the 1 writing the review, I give it 5 stars.  LOVE the retractable cord!
At this point I've had this hair dryer for over a year. I don't have any complaints it' works well. I blow dry my hair about 5 days a week.
I bought this dryer for travel but  I am using it regularly at home.  It's good weight although it's not lighter than my 'regular' dryer.  I had hoped for a little less weight but I like it anyway.  I also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer.  Although not essential, it was good to find something besides black...why are colors so hard to find?  This is definitely a 'thumbs up&#34; product.
This is a great hair dryer. The light is a nice feature. It is a bit bright though as I already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better.
It is very powerful and also smaller than my old hair dryer and so handles very well for my small hands.  It's always ready at a second's notice.
This is a professional hair dryer. It dries hair quickly and it lasts and can be repaired. I would highly recommend it.
very good i really like it also used for facial which is amazing. kinda expensive. but worth the money haha
I LOVE this drier as it is compact, folds, takes little space in the suitcase and works well. I don't use it often as it stays in my suitcase and is ready for the next trip.
I discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband. It was a high end hotel that we stayed in. I was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional. The retractable cord is a bonus. It's not the quietest hair dryer but, it isn't obnoxious, either. You gotta expect some noise with that much power. I love it.
I am on my second one of these, I love them so much..I had the original for five years and it started to make a little noise..didn't want to be without one, so I ordered a second,..my best friend is still using it and I have my new one.
Purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up.  This one is compact and I love the retractable cord.  I have VERY thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts.
This dryer is different than any dryer I have had before. First off its very light. Second it doesn't ruin your hair like normal dryers do with high heat. This still produces heat but not like the old dryers that will burn your hair off.
Bought this to replace my (extremely) old dryer. This thing is fantastic. It now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair (after its air dried for a while but still) and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause.
I needed a fast blow dryer that wasn't too expensive or really loud. This one did the trick. I've had it for awhile now and it's really held up. With me and my three teenage daughters using it, that's really saying something.
I was looking for a lightweight and quiet dryer.  This is perfect.  Although I do not need the long cord now, it would have been great in other bathrooms.  Love the quiet .  It is replacing an old Brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy.
This is very, very quiet. It has the longest cord. I have ever seen on a dryer. I don't understand the ion thing.
I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that's stupid...and I'm cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it's pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).<br /><br />I recommend this dryer highly!  No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!
This thing dries my hair super quick. Cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since I bought this. Doesn't get super hot but very powerful!
I never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair!! I'm a cancer survivor and have been growing out my hair.  I needed a new hair dryer and I didn't want another one from the drugstore.  I started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the Onei hair dryer. I love the different settings and it's light weight in your hand. Just wish it had a retractable cord. It's a great medium priced product.  You certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the Onei is perfect!!
My daughter has this dryer and it worked so well I wanted one! Fast, fast, fast, and I have a lot of hair!
Been using this dryer for the past 6 months and it's works great. The hot setting is not &#34;burn your scalp hot&#34; but warm enough to dry your hair rapidly. Great for styling hair also.
This has the performance I was looking for.  I have fine, straight hair that I blowdry almost daily and this has the power to not only cut down my drying time but also makes it so I dont have to use the flat iron as much because it powers out the waves I do have.<br />I do sometimes hit the cool button by accident while drying because of where its located on the handle but I can live with that.<br />My sister had this dryer before me and I had to copy her.  The only con I would say is it doesnt get super hot but my daughter loves that about it when I blowdry her hair.
Purchased based on reviews and two features:  folding handle and retracting cord.  Useful in the home and for travel. Performs as advertised and rated.
This hair dryer works well! I like its capacity while using it on my hair. i would recommend this product to any one who is looking for a simple dryer.
I love this hair dryer!  It is quiet, there are 3 temperature settings, hot/warm/cold, and 2 speed settings.  I love the retracting cable, which allows for easy uncluttered storage.  I did have to get used to holding it securely while I pressed the button on the side to retract the cable, though, dropping it the first time, because I didn't have a good hold on it.  I had really long hair when I first got it, and then I cut my hair super short recently, so I have yet to figure out how the diffuser works.  I can't wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out.  This is definitely a good price for a great product!
This is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product it is a winner. Thanks again!
I was looking for a travel hairdryer.  This is the ONLY hairdryer that I could find that had the retractable cord.  That does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle.  The handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily.  No buttons etc.  It does stay in place when using it.  Super duper drying power!<br />Product Dimensions: 4.1 x 8.1 x 6.1 inches ; 1.6 pounds<br />That said it is bigger and heavier than I wanted for travel but getting smaller like I have had in the past (and can't find) didn't work nearly as well.  I am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design I would think.<br />All in all, its a great dryer and the best I have found for travel and function.
This is a good dryer while it lasts. Quiet, good heat, not too heavy. But I have owned it less than six months and yesterday it stopped producing heat, just blew cold air.
Absolutely not complaints about this thing. Gives off lots of heat, has adjustments for everything and it retracts the cord when not in use.
The design is extremely well done with a fast dry and not that heavy.  The switches are out of the way and there no accidently switch off or temperature change.
I've had 2 Conair dryers which have failed me in the last couple of years....This has ION select so you can use this feature if you want or turn it off.
This dryer is so easy to handle, dries your hair quickly without drying it out (like regular blow dryers do).  It also gets your hair pretty straight, so you only have to go over it with a ceramic flat iron for a more intense shine or control of the ends of your hair (curl or flip or bend, etc...)
This is a terrific unit. It has separate heat and power adjustments.  Can be strong or gentle. Dried my thick medium length hair in 3 minutes. Every bit as good as units costing 4x as much. Why would you buy anything else? My previous Conair lasted over 10 years.
I love my Andis blow dryer!! This thing is great! It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don't want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say 'professional').  This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  The cord could be a tad longer, but I would have a 30 foot cord on all my gadgets if possible so it may just be me.  I would recommend this dryer. I only use one nozzle for it though, I feel like the other nozzles it came with don't fit, however I could just be mixing them up because I've had so many blow dryers throughout the years.
It has great power for such a little hair dryer.  I have very thick long hair and it does a great job.
This was a requested item for my daughter for Christmas. I don't use this so I can't comment on them personally. I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn't like this so that is a plus. Please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review. I'm always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues.
I gave this to my daughter that is going to college and storage is a big concern.  She has only had this for about 3 weeks, but I love the cord storage feature.
Daughter wanted this hairdryer.  She loves it.  Compact and easy to hold.  Color scheme is great.  Decent price compared to what is found in stores.
I used to have a Babyliss (Conair's high-end line) and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it. After a while I got fed up with the Babyliss and decided to purchase this well-rated hair dryer.<br />I like that there are three temperature settings, good air flow, and two attachments for channeled or diffused air. I have curly hair, so I use both attachments and are happy with their performance. Another great thing about this product is that I can feel safe that the intake side won't suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss. The mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration. The intake is also very easy to ope/close, which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime. Whenever I clean the intake, I feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning.<br />I have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality.
My daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  The color is generic, but I must say, it works fabulously!  A lot of heat, a lot of air, and I can also easily push a button for cool air with my thumb to set a curl with a round brush.  I can turn it off and on and off again to re-roll my hair with both hands, without it refusing to turn back on until the entire machine cools down 10 minutes later.  I can set my hair with it in about 5 minutes!  Electric cord works great with it, too.
This was a gift and I couldn't have chosen a better product myself.  I am able to dry my hair in about half the time w/o a lot of frizz.  It is light-weight and the placement of the controls are perfect. No accidental control switching while holding and styling.  Never heard of this company but you won't be disappointed.  Give it a try.
This is such an amazing hair dryer! It does my hair so fast and doesn't leave it with any static. I will buy this dryer again when I need to!
The main feature of this dryer that I find most appealing is the power.  The air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter.  I also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability -- an asset for storage and travel.
has different settings for temperature and power. works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven't yet used).
Got this for my mom for her birthday.<br /><br />It works great and she has given many compliments about it.  Good dryer apparently!
Was looking for a small, lightweight hair dryer and this fits the bill perfectly.  Easy to handle and store and enough power to get the job done.  Very pleased and satisfied with this purchase!
Night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake. Hair dryer is great. Installs either with screws or tape.
I got this as a Christmas gift in 2013 and LOVE IT!!!!  easy to assemble, not really loud, and super convenient because you can set it up any where in the house.  not restricted to sitting at a table to get your hair done.
Great hair dryer that has lasted me 5+ years and it is still going strong. The heat and power settings make this hair dryer very versatile for many hair styles.
I have really thick hair and this blow dryer dried my hair in no time. I probably will not use the diffuser but I use the concentrator nozzle. Overall, this is a great hair dryer for the price.
My days of buying $20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are OVER.  I have long thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair.  I am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails.  Hairdryers always made me cringe and using low speed is not an option for my hair.  I got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears.  It will not drive me nuts and I will no longer feel like I am waking anyone up in the house using it.  It also cranks out the air and has excellent settings to power through my drying.  Thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work!
I have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one. I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.
We travel a lot, and wanted a multi-voltage hair drier that will also work on 220 volt. The handle folds, and it is a wonderful addition to our travel.
I have wanted a new dryer for ages, but kept waiting because I couldn't decide on what to get.  This Conair is a great choice.  I never realized a dryer could actually be quiet & do such a great job on thin, flat hair.<br />The hair dryer is so quiet, compared to my old one.  My hair is smoother with no static electricity.  A really nice dryer.  The defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is.
Bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it. I even tried it out myself and want one of my own. Pricey, but amazing!
We had one previously that last for years!  Glad that we found the same to replace it.  Hope this lasts as long as the last one.  Works fgreat!
This hair dryer is everything I hoped it would be.  It is simple to use and does the job.  I have my hair professionally colored and highlighted.  I have used blow dryers, hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body I get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer.  My hair actually feels like it did when I was younger.  My only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel (of the stand) on and no instruction booklet for use.  I would like to have these things, if possible.
I love this blow dryer.  I will be getting another one for my guest bathroom. It's very powerful and I have never had any problems with it.
I broke my very old hair dryer (also 1875 watts) and was looking for a good replacement. This one was surprisingly cheap but doesn't look that way in person. The matte finish look and feels lovely in your hands, and it has some weight to it so you don't feel like it's going to break if you wave it around. I have shoulder-blade-length hair and it can dry my hair in 2-3 minutes flat.
This dryer rocks.  My daughter bought one for me last year and all of a sudden the heating element stopped working.  I had to buy another, this brand is different.  Hopefully wont have the same fate.  My hair dries in 15 minutes.
I wasn't sure about spending so much on a hair dryer. I normally just buy the ones at the drug store. This one was recommended to me since my hair is fluffy. It has an extra long cord and a cold shot too. It dries my hair without burning it, and keeps the frizz down without having to use a ton of silicone oil finishing product. I would highly recommend.
This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer. And the carrying bag just makes it that much better.
Wattage not too high and just the right size.  It's small enough to tote to the pool in my gym bag, but large enough to do a great job at home, too.  I have had it a couple of years now.  It looks like it might continue to work--unlike so many other electrical products in this day and age of globalized manufacturing.  I cannot tell you hiow much money I spend just trying to get away from products made by slave labor!
I bought this for my lady as one of her Christmas gifts. She had her last hair dryer for 7 years or so. This one drys her hair in half the time and is about 20 times quieter. I can't write much about the features, but I do know that she loves it.
I bought the dryer to dry my pets after washing them. It works well, dries quickly, has the ceramic heating element and and ion drying feature as the more expensive models. Durabilty is another variable that I can't access.
Bought this to use on a recent trip to Africa. Worked perfectly and was the solution to managing my hair in the third world. I left it there with a young lady who couldn't afford to buy one for herself.  Two happy girls.
great small hair dryer that I'm able to keep in the camper for when we travel about. takes up nearly zero space & works quite well
I purchased this dryer many years ago from a retail store.  As stated &#34;many years ago&#34;.  Easy to handle , great choices of temperatures and speed .  It finally gave out.  I tried a few other dryers,---full sized and small. and none could  compared to this mighty dryer.  Returned the other and then purchased this through Amazon.  Five stars..... !!!!!!!
Hair gets dry fast! I have long hair, below my shoulders but above waist.  It takes me 35-40 minutes (I have fine textured hair).  The temperature never feels too hot but it does the job, even at its highest level; and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer!  One can literally talk on the phone or what TV while under this dryer.  One of the pieces, the hinged hood, broke during shipping, but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it.  But I did not wait, I used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it.  It works just fine!
My mom travels a lot and this small size and ability to change electrical current for overseas a plus....no additional adaptor needed. 1875 watts is quite powerful. All you need for on the go or at home is storage is an issue.
My wife loves it, it's so quiet we can talk while she does her hair without her turning off the blow dryer to here what I said.
This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She couldn't wait to use it and she LOVES it, says its the best hair dryer out there.
Well, I cannot say enough about this product.  As other customers have also stated, I bought it for travel and now use it every day.  You will not be disappointed.
This dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time. It's evident now that the previous expensive, super powerful, tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle. Many bad hair days blamed on aging/change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer.<br />With absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days. A most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair.<br />This dryer is much quieter than the previous one. The brushed finish and brown body/pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye.
I purchased one for each person of my family and my sister has four bathrooms in her house.  She was so impressed with it, she wanted to order three more, so I surprised her and got them for her.  They are the best on the market :-)  I would purchase again.  We did put one in our 5th wheel bathroom also.
I love the wall mount hair dryers.  You always know where it is and it is never in the way. Click and it is ready to use and click it is put away.
i have fine thin hair and dont need much in the way of a dryer,this one is perfect, love the attachments, dont even need a straightner when  I use this.
I am in hair school and his dryer is perfect! Works perfectly, the best dryer out there for sure. I love it.
Bought this dryer to help with my dense wavy hair frizzing when I blow dried it. This seem to do the job well. It has lots of options for heat and speed, and gets my hair dry faster than my old &#34;cheapy&#34; dryer. I have noticed less frizzing and my hair is smoother and shiner than before. I would give it good marks for value for money, it appears to do the job as well as more expensive ceramic dryers I looked at.
For the price, I don't think you can beat this. It's very similar to professional hair dryers. The diffuser is a little big, but still does the trick. Highly recommended.
This is the best hairdryer I've ever owned!  Puts Conair and Revlon hairdryers to shame.  Time to look at other Remington products.  Finding quality these days is rare.  Happy with my purchase.
My daughter was thrilled with this blow dryer. It is so compact, that it makes packing it a breeze. It is a little heavier than you would think it would be though.
Easy to use.  It does everything that a hair dryer should. I would recommend it to anyone that needs one.
Make your hair soft, frizz free. My daughter has very thick fine hair. It does a wonderful job. Highly recommend.
I love this hair dryer - ergonimically balanced and dries hair fast. No high pitched whining noise like my old hair dryer.
I've used this for the last month now, and it is perfect. It does not get overheated, or bring the house down with noise when we use it. It is nice and handy. Blows warm air in the right proportion. I love the multiple speed and heat options Conair provided on this.<br /><br />I think this is the best product out there for around $10. I strongly recommend this purchase. :)
I don't know how it does it, but it makes my hair look like a wig.  LIKE A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL WIG.  It's smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing, it's just perfect.  Totally crazy.<br /><br />Buy it.
I purchased this hair dryer as a Christmas present and she loves it. The dryer warms instantly, looks great (the matte black....although the pink accent isn't my color), does a great job, and even has little rubber spots on the side, so that it doesn't slip (nice touch). It also has a removable filter that can be cleaned. For the price, I can't complain. I would definitely recommend this to others, as it does a great job at a reasonable price.
I've had this hair dryer for about twelve years now and my sister always uses it when she's here, so I got her one for Christmas.  It has so much power for such a compact dryer.  When mine dies, I'm going to order another one.  Love it!
Love this dryer. Have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter. So easy and so reliable. Has never let me down.
excellant hair dryer that mounts on wall to save counter space. Excellant hot air to dry hair quickly . Nice nightlight that works automaticlly.
My wife and I prefer these smaller hair dryers over the large bulky kind. This dryer puts out enough heat and air to handle our hair needs. Its small size also makes it easy to pack for traveling.
I've had this for well over a year so far and it has worked well.  It is sturdy and a little heavier than some, but not bad.  No complaints.
This is a great hair dryer and drys hair very quickly.  The attachment is great for concentrating on one area as to not make hair frizzy.  Love this dryer.
VERY QUIET.  PLENTY OF SETTINGS.  TAKES NO TIME TO GET MY HAIR DRY.  THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE STYLING ATTACHMENTS GET VERY HOT.
This one dries so much more quickly than my previous hair dryer and seems to provide a smoother finish.  Recommended.
I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She had one similar to this for many,many years and needed it replaced. To my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one.
Purchased this item for travel and it has proved to be a very good choice!  Would definitely recommend to others
This is a great hair dryer. It has a nice weight to it and a nice smooth matte finish. I have very long hair and this hair dryer works faster than anything I've ever owned. It's also surprisingly quiet to use. I'm just sad I can't take it with me when I travel.
This is the best.  My daughters and I have different types of hair and different lengths. This dryer is so easy to hold, not too heavy or awkward and does an amazing job for each of us with the different settings and attachments  Our only problem was we needed to use it at the same time...so we bought another one!!!
Great with great value.It came with instructions for use and gave us real value for our money.It is well recommended.
It was a gift my daughter requested. I purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on Christmas!
Love this dryer. I've been using wall mount hair dryers for years. Actually only one before this one which was also a Sunbeam. Nothing lasts forever. Loved the Sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too. Slender look, night light, two speeds, doesn't seem to get hot. Looks nice on the wall. Have only had this one for a month, but if it's anything like the old one it will last for years.
I used to always buy expensive dryers that ended up not being powerful enough / produced boiling lava hot air that damaged my hair unless I held down the &#34;cool&#34; button almost the entire time.<br />At a hotel, I used this blow dryer and was amazed at how powerful it was. My hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes, and the air was not painfully hot. This fabulous little dryer is also a great size for travel, or simply taking up less space in your bathroom.<br />Ditch the fancy dryers and go for this one. I can't speak to the longevity since I've only had it for a month, but I am confident it will last long enough to fulfill it's mere $20 price tag.
Twin switches for dual heat settings and dual speed settings - plus the blue &#34;no heat&#34; button.  Reasonably lightweight, comfortable grip, priced less than almost any other dryer you'll find at a store and yet works just as well, I think.<br /><br />Be a good steward and get this one.
I loved it. It does the job that I needed done.I will not change to any other dryer as long as I can purchase this one.
My better half is a professional stylist so this dryer gets heavy use. This is her third in about 8 years. Given that it,probably runs 20 hours a week I'd say that's high praise. Fast shipping too.
Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments. Since I have some curl to my hair, it's nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer. Packaged nicely and delivered on time.
I work in a beauty shop and it is wonderful it does everything I need it to do and more.
Got this for a trip to Italy.  It packed easily and took up minimal space.  You still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip.
Heats up fast, cools down quick. No waiting or anything, great product. It really worked on my wet curly hair
I found it ideal as a travel hair dryer. It's small size fits into my shaving kit, but it also surprised me just how powerful it is, to dry and style wet hair.
This was on my daughters Christmas list as a priority item. She is a hairdresser and swears that this blow drier cuts 20 minutes off her styling time. She was thrilled with this blow drier!
This hairdryer works great and is at a great price point. I don't have any complaints on it, but will warn people that the cord is a little shorter than usual.
Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful! This is a fantastic styling tool, comparable with my stylists dryer for sure! I highly recommend this dryer. AND IT'S ANIMAL PRINT!!! BONUS!
I don't have much insight for the hair dryer's performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &#34;I Love It!!&#34;.  After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).
I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.
Its a great hairdryer. Its much less noisy than some of the  others. It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before. It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair
Excellent product.
I like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out. I have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry, but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer.<br /><br />The only downside is that I wish the cord was longer! My old hairdryer had a much longer cord and I was spoiled by it.
This is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one. I really like this product, dries hair fast and I can sit comfortably while waiting....the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying, however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting. It is big, so I store it in my closet, luckily I have a walk-in.
This product is just perfect for the teen I purchased it for...she's really in to primping and this saves time and is easy to use! Love it!!
Three speeds (noise) and two heat settings. My 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds. Great buy for yhe price.
One of our daughters had this item on her &#34;wish list&#34;.  She was excited when she opened it.....very proud of her gift.  Appears to be of good quality and looks durable.
I love this dryer. The cord system is super convenient.Easy to use for a reasonable price. Get it! you wont regret it.
I really like this little hair dryer, and it is all that I really need.  I have long hair but it can be totally dry in 5 minutes with this unit!
lightweight and fast drying, just what I wanted, excellent quality, good settings.  I like the longer cord, no need for an extension cord!
This was a definite Christmas favorite...great color, works great, has the cool styling attachment which was a hit!!!  My daughter loves it!
mom will love this one. Don't need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad
I've used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!
I have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30+ years and they often break within a year.  I have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong.
I'm not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  This hair dryer is amazing.  It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you'll get it pretty quick!
Used on my 5 yr old with African American natural hair. Does a super job especially when used in combination with a smoothing serum. When I use this dryer I'm cool with delaying flat ironing. Just ponytail her up.
This is all I had hoped it would be. It has great power and it is the nice compact small size I desired.
Pleased with new blow dryer.  Dries hair, just as advertised.  Love the retractable cord.  Keeps my gym bag a little less messy.  Love the red.
The matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer.  It is great - looks good and has a great - soft texture.  The temperature settings are low, med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air.  The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.<br /><br />Even an 80's era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.  The entire band can share one 225NP and still be on the stage in time to rock the house!<br /><br />Medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz.
This dryer is every thing that it says it is! Quiet, professional looking comfortable to use and attractive on the wall. It is certainly a quality item and I would recommend it to anyone
This is my second Portofino 6600.  My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.  Also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments.  This dryer has by FAR outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price.  I would do commercials for this dryer!
I have one of these already and love it. Will make a great gift. It is powerful & the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!
My wife swears by this hair dryer and she is on her third unit. That may sound bad, but each one has lasted 5 years, so definitely seems okay for the price.<br />Lightweight, nice rubber grip, and not too loud.
Mom was desperate for a new dryer even though she doesnt use the old one she has now.<br />But besides that this was a perfect upgrade.
I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great. I love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds. It is great for travel but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend's house since it works so well. My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.
I am natural with thick thick African American hair.  My hair goal is to get to waist length and don't like flat ironing my hair.  The last time I went to a salon, I came out smelling my hair like it was burned.  So I started looking for a blowdryer that will make my hair straight but not flat ironed.<br /><br />I did research and decided to try this.  God... I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee it.  I just finished blowdrying my hair and it looks just the way I wanted it.  Not too straight with some volume to it.  Ughhh.. Why didn't I buy this a log time ago?<br /><br />NOTE TO SELF: AFTER DOING RESEARCH, READ REVIEWS, QUICKLY BUY PRODUCT..<br /><br />Try this if you want to... you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />XoXo
I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  I decided to try this dryer and it really works.  It is so lightweight and I can't believe it can even dry my hair.  I only take it with me now.
Love this hairdryer.  Not only does it dry my hair quickly, but the three heat settings mean that I don't have to rely on the hottest setting.  And, if you have fine hair,  it does not create static like some other hair dryers can do in cold weather.
Love this hair dryer.  Cool, medium, high settings great...but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  An ionic dryer without being my work-out also!  Shiny hair in quick time.  Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?
I've been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.
I love the folding handle & retractable cord. Compact & light. Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.
I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.
Just great. . And compacted.  A lot of power<br />Doesn't over heat... great for the price and for first time users
Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage it's a plus.<br />But you'll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one.
This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought., yes I would recommend this to anyone.<br />Haven't found anything I dislike.
The best hair dryer, ever! Always leaves my hair straight with lots of body. I've had my first one for at least 7 years. I was trying to share it with my sister & her daughter. Now, I'm having my own daughter soon, so I gave my sister the first one & I bought another one.
THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I KEEP ONE IN EACH BATHROOM AND A SPARE IN THE LINEN CLOSET FOR REPLACEMENT USE!  VERY CONVENIENT.
Whenever I buy a house i always install one of these in the master bathroom.  This is my 3rd one.  Very convenient, very strong, very hot,
Love this item.  Easy to install.  Very easy to use.  Its always handy and easy to get too. Heat and air is perfect as far I am concerned.  Would highly recommend.
I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.
This was a great purchase for me!  Dryer has great power and drying ability, very efficient!  I would highly recommend!  The item was exactly as described!
I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.
Great dryer.  Nice heating controls, average weight.  I have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it.
This is a great little hair dryer.  I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  I was hesitant about the retractable cord, but it works great and I have not had any issues with this dryer at all, Good purchase.
This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I've had.. I wouldn't say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!
Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don't have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!
This item came fast and as of this writing, she hasn't opened the gift.  Looking forward to seeing her eyes on this item.  Thanks again.
I love the adjustable heat, I love the attachments and works and lasts for years! it was everything i could want in a hairdryer
This hair dryer is EVERYTHING!! I absolutely love it!! I am African American and have very kinky hair. This dryer gets my hair straight and then I only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time. I also use it for my daughter. She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!
I'm a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can't go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you.
Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer.
Dries my long hair really quickly. Very lightweight. I like that it has several settings so I have choices on strength and heat level.
This hairdryer Is similar to a blue Vidal Sassoon hairdryer (that I wrote a review about a few years ago) that seem to Not be available any more which Is easy to repair. This hairdryer Is 3 speed so the wiring Is more complicated than In the Vidal Sassoon. I have taken this hairdryer apart to clean and lubricate It, I take the back part off which has a metal screen Inside run In under the faucet with hot Water then I spray WD-40 In the motor doing that It will probably last forever. It has of get to burn out the fuse which I have bypassed a few times on the Vidal Sassoon but apparently there seems to be a piece  of plastic under to button to the switch which I lost taking It apart I put It back together and It worked right but had to use a small screw driver to turn In on and off with so I tried to modify It so that I did Not have to use a small screw driver now only high setting works. I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there.
I absolutely love this dryer! It gets really hot on the highest setting which I prefer using because it will dry my hair faster. I like that it is adjustable and you can get a chair and slide it right over. Overall, it did the job of drying my hair and I'm satisfied.
Bought one for our winter home also because its a great space saver and its extremely convenient to have it right at your fingertips.  Very powerful for a little dryer.
Love this hair dryer! 2nd I've owned. First one I got on QVC- Amazon was cheaper to go for this one!  T3 is worth it for hair dryer- I know they r much more expensive- but worth the price. Drying time is less- cuts down on frizz.<br />I'll never go back to store brand!!
I have been using this model for the last 10 years, it only been replaced for once.  It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light.
Can't get a much better hair dryer for this price. Have had no problems with it. My wife loves it and uses it all the time!
I LOVE MY HANGING HAIR DRYER, I NEVER HAVE TO DRAG IT OUT OF A DRAWER AND PUT IT BACK IT IS ALWAYS THERE IT HAS A NIGHT  LIGHT BUT I USUALLY UNPLUG IT UNLESS I HAVE COMPANY THE LIGHT COMES IN VERY HANDY THEN IT HAS PLENTY OF AIR FOR BLOWING MY LONG HAIR AND I ALSO LIKE THE WAY I CAN HANG THE CORD UP
No more tangled cord! Love this dryer. It is also pretty quiet for it's high wattage. I recommend this dryer.
Love this hair dryer.  It takes less time for me to dry my hair. I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer
Works like a charm! I love it! It does a great job for the money that I spent on it!
I used this product at a Marriott Hotel and loved it. It has multiple settings, a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair. The retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.
Love this hairdryer it is one of the best hairdryers I have ever used in my life!  I ordered this for a friend who had one already but I should have kept it for myself as a back up incase my ever died but I had it for about 3 years now and nothing went wrong yet!
I love this blowdryer. It is light-weight and portable. I love how it folds up for when I travel. It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.
Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter.
Great traveling Hair Dryer.  I used this when I went to Florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the Handle.
My wife bought this, but I'll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn't expect.
Excellent! Can't believe how smooth my hair is since using this dryer. Dries my hair in half the time. Love it!
It's little, and it's POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &#34;Mighty Mini&#34;?<br /><br />For all the reviewers that complain about the size and how &#34;cheap&#34; if feels, realize that you are buying something made for travel, and that it cost a whopping $20.<br /><br />This is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />If you want a bigger, more expensive one, then go find one elsewhere.
I've only had this for about a week but I'm pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this.
Used it at a hotel and had to have one. This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Dries fast cuts drying time in half, and doesn't make my hair frizzy. Highly recommend it!!
This was the first product I buy on amazon, the thing is heavy but it works amazing , is big but I won't change it for nothing!! The prize it's awesome comparing with what you can do with this thing, best thing it won't damage ur hair !
Don't be fooled by its tiny size...it is so powerful! It dries my hair as fast and my big one! It's cute, convenient and efficient. I love it!
Its just what I needed. Its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap. I like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower.
I have thick, curly hair that I blow out every few days. This blow dryer has cut my drying time in half! The air force is STRONG with this one. Put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying. But it gets the job done, and incredibly well. My hair is *less* dry from this dryer, despite the high heat, and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out.<br /><br />WORTH IT!
All the product I purchased from Blue Novelties thru Amazon were Christmas gifts for my girls. They were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked. I'll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on. I love shopping at Amazon.com and I have found a friend in Blue Novelties. Please email me a catalog so I can give it to them. Problem NOW is... they fight over the products.<br />...I can't win, no matter how much I try!  Thanx...Mr. Mac
This blowdryer is a great product.  It is lightweight and dries your hair fast.  It is a super product for the price.
Great hairdryer. Works perfectly fine. It dries my hair in less than 5 minutes! My hais short but a bit thick.
Small, powerful,easy to take on trips,..,occupies very little space, light weight, works in Europe with no hassle,easy to pack,attractive design
Very strong wind produced by this hairdryer.  Dries my hair very fast, the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry:)  I have long thick hair and I can dry it in about 6-7 mins.  Great product ordered as a replacement after my old one (same hairdryer) died.
Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand.
Installed in guest room bath; and it's a nice extra that is convenient and out of the way.  Especially liked that the cord is not dangling!
This is a small powerful hair dryer. It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color. Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.
I use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy. Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running. Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror. I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.
I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price. I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth and straight.this it's the second one I bought.  One For Home And One For word. Love it.
Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend.
I have a small bathroom, so putting the hair dryer on the wall is a great solution. It is at my fingertips!
Works well. Perfect for travel. Compact, light weight, as good as any full size dryer. Pretty sturdy also. I'd recommend it.
Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.
I love that this dryer is compact and really BLOWs the air at your hair.  I found this in a hotel and liked it so I looked it up and bought it from amazon.  Love the price, too!  I have a $150 dryer, which I really like, but it just doesn't blow the hair as strongly as I would like sometimes.
The best blow dryer ever. 23 Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair and I hate doing it myself but this definitely helps out when I'm tryna save money but skipping the salon
Bought for a trip to Europe; worked great with an adapter; no troubles. Small and easy to fit into luggage!
Quality hair dryer, works perfectly. You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall. Runs and runs and runs forever, really.
This is everything I need in a hair dryer. I have medium-textured wavy hair, and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves. They turn out with great volume and shine (my husband says my hair is &#34;fluffy--but in a good way&#34;), and less frizz than I get with letting my hair air dry. Overall, the product does its job and I am very pleased.
Great hair dryer!  I have short hair and can dry my hair in about 90 seconds.  It also is small enough to not take up too much room on the bathroom counter, and is light and fits well in my hand.
Makes Blow drying so easy. I have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy. Easy to handle and does not get too hot.
My wife loves it
I needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence.  I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one
Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair. Only regret I have is not buying sooner! Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair.
Great product.  Wasn't sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.
good hairdryer - cheap, not too big, not too loud and lightweight. dries my hair quickly and it is powerful
This is by far the best hair dryer you'll ever own. I have wavy, thick (not complaining), out of control hair that is usually best left to dry on its own. But this dryer straightens it without use of any additional hair products. I am impressed!
This is great product.  I brought one for my sisters and mother.  They really love it.  I also put on in our RV coach.  I would recommend to everyone.
Decided to buy this hairdryer based on what my hair stylist said. I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &#34;game changer&#34;. Definitely, helped me get ready for my day a lot faster.
gave this as a gift & she loved it... it made her drying time half of what it was & she has long thick hair! thanks!
I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister's hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I'll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair & finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !
so strong and dries well. love it! i have been using it for ever since but had no problems. :)
This little dryer is amazing.  Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  My cousin just loves it.
Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It's so small and lightweight I forget I'm holding a blow dryer!<br />Don't be fooled by the small appearence, you'll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one! I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split.<br />Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!
A great replacement for a dryer I had for years. It is, in fact, better than the one I had. A pleasure to use.
I like this hair dryer.  MUCH lighter than my old one and dries hair great.  I like that the concentrator is included.  The intake screen in the back is removable, so I can clear out the dust that collects.
I absolutely LOVE this blowdryer. It makes my hair so shiny and nice. It also blowdries it in less than 10 minutes (and I have pretty long hair) I have already had 3 friends test this out and buy it.
In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.<br /><br />It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),<br /><br />The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings.
Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife. This one is very light so it's not very tiring for the wrist.
Excellent in every way! Was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn't be happier.
Love this hair dryer!  Perfect price & works great.  I would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation.  I use both attachments, and both work great.
I bought this because I loved the idea of having a retractable cord. The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn't seem to get very hot, so I don't have to wait for it to cool before putting it away.
I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!
Works perfectly if you follow the directions for use. Folds nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space.Glad to have it with me on my European travels!
It's powerful, not too loud, and not as heavy as people seem to say in other reviews.  Very efficient and does a great job.
My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It's a little pricey, but isn't your time worth something?
This dryer cut my drying time down from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes! I have medium length hair - Great price, Love it!
I had to replace my 8 year old Turbo Power and didn't even consider purchasing a different brand. It dries and straightens my very curly hairy in no time with salon quality.
It is in use every day.  There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them.
I use this to straighten my hair. I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do. It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything. I have had this for years and use it weekly. I definitely will buy it again if I it ever breaks.
Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.
Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn't get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !
Love this dryer, works so great and fast too. Bought it for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it! She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her.
I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It's an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn't hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it's a fabulous Christmas present!!
I love the power of this blowdryer, it is the only one that works for me, I have tried others and there is a big difference, I am glad that I was able to find this one, they are not easy to find.  Thank you for having it!
Perfect for use in our motor home, hooked on the wall next to the sink, don't have to dig for it under the sink.
Happy happy happy.  Great air dryer (as per my wife).  This thing can blow some air.  Great product and feels good.
This item is very great for its price. I would recommend others to buy it if they're looking for a hair dryer for less money. It also came in time, maybe in 5 days. Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me.
This dryer works well with a round brush. I almost don't need to straighten it. It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.<br />It's not too heavy but it feels well put together.
I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.
Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  Perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month.  No problem with the retractable cord yet but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point
I am so impressed with this hair dryer it's straightened my hair and I don't have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.
I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job.
Perfect for vanity top storage! I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder. So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. Problem solved! The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.
Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!
This dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy.
Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.
This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I'm down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.<br /><br />Excellent dryer for this price!
Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.
Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend!
I have had it for about 2-3 months and its just perfect!!! I love the color love the way it works and I am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels! It dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it's humid outside!
This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer.
excellent product we got as a gift. She loves it. It was just what she wanted. It works really well.
Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!
This blow dry is awesome!!! It dries my hair so quickly! I have used blowdryers, but this one beats them by a long shot. I like that it is heavy duty and built to last. Looking forward to having this for a long time.
Great size and powerful air.  The tools that come with it are very useful and for me don't have a problem staying on.
This is a great, great blow dryer. It straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer I've owned. I love it.
This dryer is perfect for a first timer's dryer, it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right. It works well and the cord has just about the right length. Its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling. You don't want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy.
Works great!  Our camper has a small bathroom. I needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way.  This one is perfect!
It is a very good dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!
Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!
I bought this dryer because I was taking a trip to Ireland, and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage. Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  LOVE it!
Great hair dryer.  And the price was great too.  It's sturdy.  It is a little hard to get used to with the controls being on the inside of the handle, but once you do it's super.  I use it on my dog after his shampoo and he likes it too.  :).  Would recommend.
I have had this hair dryer for a year now and I love how quickly it dries my hair.  It also gives my fine hair more volume.  When I travel and use a hotel hair dryer, I can really tell the difference and miss my hair dryer!  It has a 5 foot cord and several drying options.  My only minor negative is where the buttons are located, I sometimes hit them when I grab the hair dryer.
This is a great dryer; the handle folds down for easy compact storage.  I also like how it is dual voltage, but I'm not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas.
I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.
OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.  That process has gone from fast to lightening fast thanks to this Sedu.
This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it's ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.
Easy wall mount.  Plenty of power with two settings.  Easy clean filter.  The cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration.  Overall, I would purchase again.
i thought I was just buying a cheep retractable cord dryer....it works better than all of my salon quality dryers! So happy.
I'm a hairdresser, so I can sometimes go through blowdryers easily. However, this one has lasted over a year! I've bought TwinTurbo dryers before, but this model is compact enough that I can transport it from work to home easily, but the quality is not sacrificed. I love the black matte plastic, too. It makes any scratches or dings practically invisible.
I have been using the Blo & Go for nearly two years and love it.  I have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror - and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time.  It's been like that for awhile.  Please start selling these again or tell me where I can get one.  Thanks!
I love this hair dryer it work really well. Heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower. easy to use. I never have issues using this dryer.
I hotwired this to the wall in guest Bathroom. I am happy and they are too. It has two settings and looks nice on the wall just as a hotel set up. Thanks for a great hair dryer!
Great hair dryer. Perfect power and the tools that it came with are great for styling your hair. The best part of this product is that the cord is retractable. Perfect for staying organized!
I bought two of these and they work well.  One that I had for two years now has one broken switch, but is still useful.  I use these for heating and drying a wide variety of things.
I searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking Amazon.  I had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won't break in my thick hair.  This dryer not only fits the universal comb, but it comes with its own comb which works just as well.  It gets pretty hot, so it doesn't take that long to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.
I love this hair dryer. It dries very fast and accurately. I love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels. Great product!
nice hot blow drye, lots of power. it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff but i can breeze through any blowdry with ease. love it.
Best blow dryer I've had yet! The diffusser stays attached securely and it's not that loud. I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.
Another 5 star rating for this hair dryer!  I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I've used, and dries it straighter.  I don't have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  Good buy!
Wife's favorite color is purple, so this was a must have for her. The dryer works really good and looks good also.
Great product.<br />Powerful and dry hear fast. A bit heavy though but once you get used to it, it is doing its job perfectly
Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta that's tuts tote wall and shuts off when returned to base.
I had just used it once last night but I know it just what I want. Strongly recommend. It's better than what I had expected.
My Ginga loves this hair dryer and won't use anything else she has long red hair that took a while to dry with other hairdryers. Not this one though, we just recently got into an argument over the amount of crap she packs and the hairdryer is one of them. Happy wife is a happy life though and I have to admit it does cut down on the amount of time it takes to get ready!!!
An excellent product. Sets up in seconds, easy to sit under, temp control is perfect. I LOVE HOT TOOLS, THE BEST MADE BRAND!
I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it. I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn't make her hais as static as other blow dryers..
We have 3 of these, one in each bathroom. They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good.
I've had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I've decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don't like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather.
So far-pretty good. I have been using this dryer for a couple of months now and it gets the job done. What more can be said? It was a good price and it dries my hair..
I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.
This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too.
I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn't work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don't want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell's Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it's pretty huge. Right now, it's in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again.
Excellent Hair Dryer--my wife, daughter and guests love them.  Very well made.  Seem to last forever.  I am installing two more so we have one in each bathroom.  The first one is about 10 years old and running strong.
I love this hair dryer!!! It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  It feels so nice, it's making me want to wash my hair right now!
Awesome. Retractable cord works great. Blowing power is great. Light and easy to store. Bought it for our new camper.
So far so great.  It dries my hair in a jiffy. I like the looks of it too, and the accessories. It is a 1875 watt hairdryer.
I used this every day.  Our master bathroom is small which is why I wanted a wall mount.  Works perfectly and installed in minutes.
First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give.
My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it. I wrote the model number down and bought this one. It has a nice hang-up bracket, a built-in night light, moves a surprising amount of air and works great.
I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she's running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)<br /><br />This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.<br /><br />The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks' use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too.
My husband I travel a lot.  There are times we need a blow dryer.  The dryer is small and doesn't weigh much.  We keep it in our suitcase all the time.  Its perfect!
Nice blower for personal use....it heats well. I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min
Love love love this blow dryer twin turbo is the way to go... It's fast and it's easy and it gets the job done ..... I would recommend this to anyone
Used this in a hotel while away and researched it. Found on Amazon at a great price and bought two.  Nice, lightweight hairdryer that gets the job done quickly.  Would highly recommend.
It came very soon after ordering it.  It performs exactly as it was advertised.  It is very easy to use and the recoiling power  cord is very convenient.
GREAT PRODUCT AND CAME AS DESCRIBED. ORDERED FEW MONTHS AGO AND STILL WORKING AWESOME. GREAT PRODUCT FOR GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT
This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It's a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn't get tired.
it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend
Plugged it in, dried my hair.<br />Brilliant!<br /><br />Cord is a little short, if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand, but the dryer itself is good for what it does, not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself, but effective in drying my thicker hair.<br /><br />I like it!
How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you're looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one!
This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  It's amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  As soon as I got home, I got online and ordered it.  I have had MANY dryers before this, but this is the best and the best price.  Highly recommend!
I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!
A great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair, therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair!
Works perfectly!!! I really love this blow dryer and the price is just incredible! I would recommend the blow dryer!
it is very powerfulâ€?i like it very much!!!!!  it save me a lot of time to dry hair! ho ho
This mini dryer is perfect for travel.  I have used it several times and am impressed.  It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  It has a lot of force and does a great job.
We were staying in a hotel in DC. The hotel furnished an Andis dryer with retractable cord. I enjoyed using it so much so I ordered one as soon as we returned home. It came just a few days later. Im very happy with it.
Love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the Conair is operating GREAT!  It's also a great weight and wattage for drying your hair.
I researched and read reviews.  This was one of the better ones I found.  After I received it I opened and used it.  The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  Then you can set it on warm and its good.
This blow dryer is the greatest hair tool I've purchased in a long time. I can do my daughters hair now with ease and less pulling out of our thick curly hair!
I've been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces (I forgot I left it on top of my car), but I thought they were no longer making them.  Lo and behold, I was at a hair salon in New Orleans, and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies.  I exclaimed how much I missed mine from the 70's, and she informed me &#34;honey, they're still makin these puppies.&#34;  So I am now reunited w/ my beloved yellowbird.
my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too. I also ordered some extra combs just in case.
My husband and I have used Andis hair dryer for years.  When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn't find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  we love these dryer and glad to find them again.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Ruth O'Dell
I looked at this little dryer for one criterion that was my exclusive priority - I wanted a small handheld dryer that would not scare my pet cockatiel bird when I dry him after his shower in the winter! Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center.
Not too big, not too small.  My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it's done.  Easy Peasy.
Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!
I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!
Love this !!! Exactly what I was needing and wanting ! It's fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel
Couldn't find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  The Andis Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer lives up to my expectations. It's everything I hoped to find.  I especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn't increase so that it doesn't make styling harder.  I would buy this hair dryer again.  .
My customers  and my family love it so I love,  I will continue to promote it the best way I can .
I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  I also has a night light on it.
I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product.
I love this.  Very quick and easy to mount on the wall.  Very convenient and no mess on the counter!  Always available when you want it.
Love this! It's stronger than most blow dryers I've used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!
This hair dryer is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Great product in a compact size and a low price that doesn't reflect the product - it works as good as any large expensive hair dryer.<br /><br />Great for home use and packs in a suitcase for travel nicely.
Have had this dryer for about a year. When I first received it I was concerned that it did not seem to blow as hard as the dryer I had been using but it actually seems to dry my hair faster.
This is a great blow dryer! The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.
This dryer is great I have had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems whatsoever.<br />Very impressive.
You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home. Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender
My wife and I got this to replace the same hair dryer we had used for years.  The old one started making a noise that sounded like lint was getting into the fan blower chamber.  In an attempt to clean it, I broke it... I know, smooth move!!  Long story short is that we were amazed to find the exact same dryer on Amazon for $13, so we snagged it.  Great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time (as long as I stay away from disassembling it).  FYI, the sound the old one was making was no big deal.  I just felt handy for an hour and I broke it.
The best. doesn't burn ur ears dries effectivly if it ever stops working im coming back to u for anotherone.. I luvv it I luvv it
love love love this hair dryer makes my hair blow out nicely without the frizz nice finishing touch. Thank you.
I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  I wanted something small so it was easy to store.  It is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts.  I do wish it had hook or something from which I could hang it.  it arrived on time in good packaging.  I would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight.
Have had several before, wife like the convince of being hung on wall.  This is our third unit, wish it was more durable.
This is an excellent little hairdryer!  It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  I've had mine for about a year, and it is still going strong.  I just bought my mother one for her birthday (she loves it), as well as a second one for myself for travel.
We first used one in a hotel we stayed and my commented that exactly what we need for home. So I did a search and found them on Amazon and the rest is history.  We love it.<br /><br />Thanks,
I've dried my hair twice with it and it made my hairstyle work easier than with my old hairdryer that is losing it's power.  Happy with the temperatures and heat.
this is the 3rd one i've owned. i now have 2 (keep one in the guest bathroom). love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings.
have been looking for a dryer likke this ne for a while now and I finally found it. Great product to own
This hair dryer is so good that I ordered another one just In case the one I bought 4 years ago dies!, I have not had to use the new one yet, just have it for back up. I can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight.Use it with ceramic hairbrush (can order together) for sleek straight, non frizzy hair.
I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....then I found this little wonder and I'm a happy camper.  It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer.
I love my Wall mount hair dryer. It's right there when I need it. I would highly recommend this to<br />all my friends!
I like it so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom, if it didn't fold I couldn't put it in draw.
Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power. Works great
The wife loves this.  She's in sales and is very particular about her hair. Neatness really counts in her business. The item is all it was stated to be. We'll packaged delivered on time. She can't stop talking about this item. She's telling all hers friends.
This blow dryer lives up to its claims.  Dries hair fast tames frizzies and gives my fine and thin hair volume.  I like that it folds and it is very light weight.  I am a little worried as to the warranty because their website states only certain authorized dealers are covered.  Amazon is not one of them.  I trust that Amazon will stand behind this sale as they always do.
I love it!!  It's  well built, strong stream and easy to manage -- it's the best one I've ever owned!
It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn't work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn't blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn't replace it.<br /><br />REVISED: December 1, 2015<br />This new review is LONG overdue.<br />NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.<br /><br />After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can't believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It's so easy to style my hair now. And it's quiet AND light.  If you're on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can't thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.
Really pleased with this blow dryer. Quiet and easy to use.  Looks great also love the color.  Love the retractable cord
I love this blow dryer. It's very light.<br />I didn't really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.<br />I gave it to my daughter and I got this one for myself. Good product.
Very good hair styler. I like that you can buy tools for it if you need them. It has just the right amount of power to easily dry hair
Bought this as a gift and my wife absolutely loves it. She says its the best hair dryer she has ever had. And I cant complain about the price. I would recommend this to anyone.
This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  We haven't used it yet,b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price.
I had one for a year or two, but I dropped it.  So, I ordered the same one.  Pretty much perfect.  Note that the retractable cord didn't work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  Really good dryer.
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.... MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT AND DRYS IN HALF THE TIME OF MY OLD DRYER WHICH WAS OVER 15 YEARS OLD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I HAD BEEN MISSING BY NOT HAVING A TOURMALINE CERAMIC DRYER
I wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the US and when traveling abroad. This dryer functioned well in Europe and everyone borrowed it. It is small, comes with it's own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.
It kicks out the heat doesn't take up space, neat, nicely sized, blows like an hurricane you' ll love it.  Needs an man to install there isn't anyway I could 50 year old women.
This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  Just one button for low and high and it dries hair really good.  There is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air.
Great product for the price. Cheap and real strong heat. I definitely highly recommend this product. It works tremendously well.
Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly & to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product.
I just love my new hair dryer!  My husband got me this after I learned that I have some hearing lost.  (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I've owned.  What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren't disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it's definitely worth every penny!
My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!
it came on time, I have not use it yet, but feel it will do what I need .  I wanted a comb attachment
this works wonders with kinky hair, use it to straighten hair on kids after washing. great that you can adjust the heat
Medium weight, not too heavy like other professional dryers<br />Easy controls<br />Dries hair fast!<br />No tangle or twist power cord
We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can't speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that's all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn't get as hot as my old dryer so I don't have to be careful where I set it when I'm done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use.
Perfect size for home use!  We have one in our RV and bought one for our home. This is a Quality product!
This hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks great in our bathroom and I like the way the cord stays on the hook.  No more getting the cord caught in the drawer!  The night light is a soft green and just the right amount of light in the bathroom at night to see where you are going.
My wife loves it. She has evev reconended to familes and friend. The item has meat all expectations. Thank you
When it comes to hair dryers, I have to be the weirdest person ever. I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I'm curious to see if it will last more than a few months.
Nice lite and compact design, perfect for traveling in Europe on rail or rental car when you have to pack lite
I have long fine hair. I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need. Having dual voltage is a plus. This one is simple, reliable, dries my hair nicely on low, and in short does what it should do. Really like the supplied cone for directed drying.
These are on the wall on our bathrooms- they look great  were easy to install and use.  They really help to clean up the clutter.
If it's possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  The dryer's best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past, well let's just say 4 decades.  The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  All controls are arranged conveniently so you don't mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the instruction manual, but thanks to this review section it's not really needed.  You won't be disappointed.
This is a really nice hair dryer.  Handle folds as advertised and cord retract works.  Fits nicely into a travel bag.  Price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment.
I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Onei dryer.  It is lightweight, quiet (!) and really can get hot so less drying time.  I am quite pleased with it.  And the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product.  I call that excellent customer satisfaction!!
Great price, great product. And I love the retractable cord!! Comes with the two attachments that work great! Buy this one!
I chose this hair dryer simply because I saw in a news article that it was highly rated and I LOVE IT. Not sure why reviews are about the button placement and weight. I am like such a baby with heavy items and this is fine. As for the buttons, you get used to it after a couple of uses. Great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty!
This is a great dryer. It is the second I've put in our home. This one has just the right power and heat!!
I have used a conair dryer before and liked it.  The last one a had lasted about 13 years, so I thought I would go with the conair<br />again, and I haven't been disappointed.
I love this blow dryer!!! I have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers I have used in the past. I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &#34;CHI&#34; can't touch this!!!
I got exactly what I needed! The product was absolutely perfect and matched the exact description on the product information. Purchased it online and then saw it in the store for almost double the price as it was here - great buying experience.
My 20 yr old dryer died :( and I replaced it with this one. It is wonderful. Works well and the heat settings are easy to change.
I bought this to take with me when I travel as the one I had used before did not have the Ionic thing.  I had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day.  He raves about it, so I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!
This is my second Conair Ionic hairdryer. This was exactly what I wanted and was not disappointed. Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling.
Compact and powerful.<br />This hairdryer works great on 220 V in Europe- it has both &#34;low&#34; and &#34;high&#34; setting available.
Very powerful and works great.  We have these in all bathrooms. I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  Mounting is easy and just plug it in.
Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design. This is a great product. I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason. Amazon replaced it right away. Excellent service!
I love it the product works great. it is not loud and it gets really hot. It was definitely worth the buy. Fast shipping too
I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact. It quickly became my go-to hairdryer and I now use it everyday. I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it. Because it is so lightweight I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong. Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.
Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  I really like this item
Came super quick (thanks amazon!) and was a good price!  This just was more convenient to me than going to my local Target and looking through their whole selection, the reviews on Amazon can be so helpful!<br /><br />Its fairly light weight, not too noisy, and seems to work just fine.  My previous model was very simliar, a Revalon.  I see no difference between the two.  I'm sure the 'soft touch' material will eventually peel off like my previous one did but that doesn't really concern me!
Really Like This Dryer My Cousin Has The Same One But Hers iS Silver<br /><br />Now I Don't Have To Go To Her House, Just To Blow Dry My HAir Now LOL ;-)
Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy.
This hair dryer works great!  My hair is dry in half the time and it's much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.
This dryer was recommended by my hairstylists. It really does make drying time fast. You won't be disappointed with this blow dryer.
Very good!! I bought it for my wife and she loves it!! I'v been buying them for a couple of years, great service!
I didn't know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer. I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair. It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair. I am pleasantly surprised by my findings. Love the dryer!
Great hairdryer, lots of power, lightweight, retractable cord, the color is great and its the best dryer I've purchased.  I don't know why I have to add more words to my review.  A few words should be sufficient!!
I have used this product for several years on trips outside the US - mostly in Europe and Israel. This is a very fine product with three important factors:<br /><br /> -- 1600 Watt. At this lower wattage, I have never had a problem with foreign electrical power in any room I have rented.<br /><br />_-- Dual Voltage. Since its a travel hair dryer - I would suggest you keep voltage at 220. I kept switching it every time I came back to US and apparently the switch broke. See Customer Service below.<br /><br /> -- Customer Service. After 2 years of use, they said no problem and replaced the hair dryer immediately.<br /><br />I wish every company was as consumer friendly as Andis and stood behind their products as they do.
My wife was looking for a high quality hair dryer for a long time. Finally, we found what she was looking for. Panasonic from Japan, product that trust :)
We had an Oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died.  This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  Power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won't have any excess cord laying around.  Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy
It's powerful hair dryer. And there're many buttoms to secure the user's safty. I like it.<br />While, it's a little noisy.
Best hairdryer ever my only complaint is that mine cracked after a year. But it still works so I guess not a problem.
I do not speak English, but I'll try, very good product, works well, has the necessary heat levels, I have not submitted any flaw, I recommend, is light, not heavy, my experience has been good with this product.
I am very happy with this hairdryer. It is very powerful. I have a long hair and it usually takes me a lot of time to dry my hair, but with this hairdryer I'm done for 5 min. It is also very light and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product.
Good, dry fast, except for the size! It is too big to take it on travel~ it can't be folded.
Good power. Light weight. Nice long cord. Only drawback is cool shot button is sensitive and in awkward place. Otherwise great dryer!!
i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i've bought.  the one &#34;con&#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair.
I've had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best. Lightweight, powerful and it makes my hair so smooth.
I was unsure of what to get for my daughter as she has thick hair, this works great for my daughter's thick hair!
This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time. The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  My husband didn't want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires.  Dryer was still working though.  The new one works just fine. I will be taking this with me when we go to U. K.
This is the best hair dryer by far.  It dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot.  The vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  I am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a Christmas present.
I always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel. Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink. Plenty of power for drying hair. Easy installation.
i got this a while back and its still working just like new. i love it. i wish the cord was longer but its pretty great and still living strong.
I am glad that I purchased this hair dryer. It is quieter than other hair dryers that I have used in the past.
I thought it was a bunch of nonsense when I read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair, but it actually reduces frizz. I'm not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it's just this hair dryer, but whenever I use it I notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through. I've had it for 2 years and no problems, definitely would buy again!
Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer. Should last her years to come.
have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer
This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.
Not much to write about, its a hair dryer, and it works.<br />It has different heat settings and cool attachments.
it has useful function to me. Good product at an affordable price,I do not regret buying itï¼?like it, love it
This was my second of this hair dryer because I accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel. I love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style. My hair is wavy/curly and I love the diffuser, my hair always looks good when I use this dryer.
This is my second dryer. The first one broke in half.  I used duct tape to make it useable until I received the new one. The motor continued to work well.<br />I ordered the same model hoping I could use the same wall mounting.  But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very loud, even though they advertise differently.  I would recommend it as is, but would love those additional features.
Was concerned about purple color, but it is not bad, it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche. The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective. Good buy.
Great hair dryer...I use it when on the road or at the gym.  I like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits (when compared to a previously owned Conair that died)...this is definitely an improvement and I recommend this effective product.
Works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz & in half the time of my old hairdryer...perfect size and weight for me.  Love the bright red color too.
This is a great product for the price. It was very easy to put together too. I would order it again.
I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting.
very high quality product.  it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.
Installed this a few months ago.  Super convenient and looks good too.  I love the night light feature as much as the hair dryer itself.  Power is good with 2 watt settings.  Iconic dryer does dry hair faster.  It was a little hard to get to the tiny screws in the back to get to the faceplate to attach to the wall, but it is sturdy.  I love the design and function.  I want to put one of these in the guest bathroom too.
This product is awesome!  Mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it.<br />We have now bought 4 of these (3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it).<br />Highly recommend!
Works great, and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button, plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it's put away. Solves my pet peeve about hair dryers. I wouldn't use anything else, so I bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these (heaven forbid).
This is a GREAT product!  Perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage!  I would recommend it highly, it would make a great travel gift.
I recently purchased this hairdryer after my previous one started to sound like a dying cat and was extremely hot to touch after use.  After a week and a half I love this new one!!!  I greatly enjoy that I can dry my hair on cool and high, with the temperature choices of cool, med and hot, as well as low and high speed settings, and cool shot to set.  It's light weight and efficient - I'd buy it again easily.
I LOVE THIS BLOW DRYER..IT STRAIGHTENS AND SOFTENS YOUR HAIR INSTANTLY LEAVING IT WITH NO DAMAGE...I USE IT EVERY DAY!
I'm a hairdresser I have try different brands this the best so far. The price is right n the brand is good.
Got it. Exactly as advertised, Prompt Services. RECOMMENDED.<br />Perfect for everybody in the family. Just a handy gadget!!!<br /><br /> Thank you very much.
My daughters aren't strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand. This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair. Wonderful!
After returning to Amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not, this one delivered on its promise.  Also, the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don't have to line up anything to put it on or remove it--it's a simple push on and pull off.  Have just started using this, so can't speak to its durability.
Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with.
Very easy to install<br />Works great and the led light is great.<br />It looks very neat on the wall.<br />The different settings are perfect.
This is the best hairdryer I have ever purchased and used. I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair. It is definitely salon quality.
I don't like a large, heavy hairdryer so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  Works just fine.
Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.<br />I would definitely recommend it to a friend. I love it!
I have long hair.  Used to take me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair.  This dryer has cut down the time to 20 minutes TOTAL.  It's a time saver.
Not sure it's a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me.<br />Also, the price is right.
Love my blow dryer.  It dries my hair asap. Good dryer, recommend. works well in all levels, love the attachments.
I had purchased one for my wife to replace another brand that had quit after two years. She loved it and it does a great job drying hair.<br /><br />I have added another one on my side of the bathroom so we don't have to share. You'll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way. Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away. It becomes part of your bathroom accessories. Love it.
Love this hairdryer!  I had no idea that there was such a big difference in hairdryers, but let me tell you, there is.  I had a Ceramic heated Conair hairdryer.  While visiting family, I had to borrow a hairdryer because I forgot to pack mine.  The way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing.  It looked so smooth and shiny.  Not the norm when using my Conair.  I looked at the name brand and took note right away.  So glad I was able to purchase on Amazon.
We purchased two dryers and love them. My wife was in a Chicago hotel where she them. After she got home we decided to order this dryer. This a great dryer for the price. We would recommend the Andis dryer to others!
We saw this in our hotel room and decided to purchase one for home and it worked out great for the guest bathroom.
Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process... this one is great! I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!
I use this everyday and absolutely love it, nice color, light weight and love the retraction cord, awesome blow dryer
I love this hair dryer. It has amazing power, yet is drying my hair very gently. My hair feels smooth after drying it which is a huge improvement compared to my previous hair dryer.
a great budget hairdryer and its also pink. that in itself is enough to love. glad I got this product and it shipped fast.
This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &#34;ionic&#34;.<br />  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.<br />  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!
anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.<br /><br />*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn't quite follow .... ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.
Who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers?  Well it's true!  This hair dryer is SO powerful, it dries my hair much quicker than other models.  I love it.
This little dryer fits the bill perfectly.  It is one great addition to our bath room.  Don,t know why we didn't get one sooner
If anyone is hesitating about whether or not to purchase this hair dryer, you'll be sorry if you don't get it! My hair is naturally curly, but it's a frizzy curl so I often like to blow dry it straight. This dryer is by far the best dryer I have ever used on my hair. Not only does it dry fast, but my hair looks shiny too, and the best part is it holds all day! The only negative thing I can say about this dryer is that the function buttons are on the inside grip, so I'm constantly pushing the buttons when I'm holding the dryer, a bad design. Otherwise, I love this dryer!
There are four thickmaned, long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling! It's also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early (5am) hair-prep. When our other hairdryer goes up in smoke, I'm going to get a additional Conair.
I purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist.  He suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when I decide to blow it out straight.  This dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair.  It's definitely worth the money.
Beyond my expectations.  I have had Vidal Sasoon dryers  for many years.  They were reliable and very good. I will continue their products.
I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.
Bought this for my boyfriends dad for his birthday.  He loved it, the cord retracts great, and it works great.  Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  Plus it gets the job done!
I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  However, this dryer does not disappoint!  It's reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  I will say, it's not particularly quiet, but I am a consumer level user so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  All in all, it's a solid purchase, highly recommended!
LOVE LOVE LOVE! It seriouskl y dried my hair half the time made it feel silky smooth its quiet compared to my drug store ones. Omg it's awesome. Buy it
Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful. Perfect for travel. Amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another, no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product.
This ceramic, ionic blow dryer is great.  It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick. Its the only one its size that has a retractable cord. I love its size/ performance.
It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I'd like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I've tried to use.  I've always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.
Love it!  Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  I'm no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us ... also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!
this dryer is very compact, and has good power for a little dryer.  I purchased it for my travel bag and used it for the first time this weekend.  I was very impressed with how hot it got, how small it was, how well it worked, and how fast it cooled after using it.  I would highly recommend.
I use this blow dryer daily, it works for me, that way I won't have to borrow my daughters on. a good price as well.
I purchased this to replace a 14 year old Conair sufferering from heating element failure.  The old I got for its claim that it was quiet, to use near my sound sensitive husband and hoped that this would be the same.  It is and more!  It does not claim to be quiet but it is.  It is delightfully light to hold too.  The 6 setting options work well.  I am more than satisfied, I now hope for a long lasting relationship.
The blow dryer works great, so far i have had no issues with it. The retractable cord is convenient. It al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers.
This is a great hairdryer for the money. It's light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer.
I absolutely love this dryer! It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot. I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.
Always wanted one of these and this one is great quality so far. My hair is so straight and tangle free. So much easier than using a comb and dryer with both hands.
I bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color. It turns out that it also is a wonderful dryer. I love it. Lots of power and quiet. /Quiet enough to use on my puppy who no longer is frightened of being dried after his bath.
We receided this product  at the Garden Hotel  in perfect conditio ok it was ok I will recommend to may relatives and friends
I really enjoy this hair dryer. I needed it to straighten my unruly beard. I don't just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient.
I was looking for something nice but quiet. This isn't bad - doesn't have the high pitched sound some of them have - though it's still a hair dryer so quiet is relative. Both attachments are easy to use and overall very happy with this dryer, especially for the price.
When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer!
The temperature and speed is just right.  It doesn't dry out my hair.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer
The hairdryer was working well but suddenly started making a really loud noise after a few months use. The seller was really helpful and sent out a new one which is working well.
This dryer is wonderful, the power you have is second to none .., a little heavy but worth it for the results it leaves. I am very happy.
this one is good and gentle on the hair, however I have not used many so cant really compare.<br />This one is nice and cheaper on Amazon so go for it.
I have been getting this dryer for 5 yrs each  time I get it I love it more.  I have now got my sisters using it.
I have limited strength in my hands and therefore needed the smallest and lightest weight hair dryer I could find and this fit the bill!  The main brands seem to no longer carry one this small, so really had to hunt for this one.  The low speed seems more like a medium speed which I liked.
I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn't bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it.
I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.
Excellent item, already bought one. Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall. Very good item. Very recommanded.
This is my third Yellow Bird.  I keep one as a spare just in case -- air flow and heat are superior to any product (including the Conair family) that I've ever used.  I've bought them for both daughters, who will also continue to use them as long as they are produced.
This dryer dries hair fast with various heat options and speed.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it. I am surprised at the complaints about this dryer.  I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.
I came across this hair dryer at a Hyatt hotel and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair) leaving it looking shinny.
This is the best blow dryer ever. Gets super hot I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer. You've got my vote.
Drys hair quick! A little bulky but worth it.  The other reviews were worth reading for this item. Thank you
This is a great hair dryer for the price, and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast.
I really like this dryer.  This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair but it straightens my natural locks
Purchased this for our trip to Europe this year.  It worked like a charm and insured that I was not going to blow up another hair dryer on our annual international sojourn.
I like this hair dryer, it comes with a defuser which I LOVE! Also it has a cooler setting which lets me style without the heat! The price is great and the dryer is top quality!
The best l have ever used.  Can see and feel the difference in the way my hair styles after drying.  Not too heavy and the controls are placed conveniently to enhance changing the temp and air velocity.  Reasonably priced and with Amazon Prime-----no tax and free 2 day shipping....hard to go wrong.
I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer. My hair was growing back thin after cancer. My old blow dryer didn't give volume to my hair as this dryer does. Wish I had it sooner.
My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews. This one had quite good reviews, and I'm quite satisfied with this purchase! :)
good product, relatively light weight and dry faster. I love the metallic look purple. I found it's better to use warm temp i/o hot temp, my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth.
Great hair dryer. Blows hard & dries my medium long, fairly thick hair dry in 3 minutes. Love it!!!! Would definitely recommend this for any type hair.
I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It's everything I was looking for and more. Perfect for get sets and tight curls.
my wife remembers her teenage days when this was all the rave ...now she uses it after shampooing and is extremely happy ...she swears this was the best product for the job and at a great price ...if you want to get something for the missus...this is it, you can't go wrong
i have thick hair and it always seems like I have to spend FOREVER drying my hair.  This blow dryer is small but powerful.  I love that it folds up to store easily.  My long hair dries in just a few minutes
So originally I had purchased a  Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer last year. The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly. The cord moves with you and was a fairly good length. I would recommend this product.
Liked it.  The cord is definitely shorter than normal. Liked it because I feel it dries well but not at the expense of my hearing.
Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used.
My elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease. It has many settings and temperatures. I highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists.
The old hair dryer that my wife and I used was old and started giving off a burnt electrical smell. While I was online ordering another product from Amazon, I decided to give the hair dryers a quick look. After looking at several, I chose this one because of its features and low price. I must say that we are quite pleased.
This blow dryer is great for traveling.  The fold up handle allows for easy packing.  The cord retractor is great
I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,<br />I used it today, and it made my hair nice and smooth.<br />It's seems nicer than I thought it would be for $20.00
Excellent hair dryer!  Bought this T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer at Amazon.com with  Zadro Next Generation Lighted Travel Mirror & 12 inch Brown Faux Crocodile Pattern 4 Extendable Trays Doctor Style Makeup Bag.  So looking forward to my next trip...  thanks Amazon!
I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It is good for the price you pay.
I like this hair dryer very much. It hangs on the wall so one does not have to get it out and plug it in. It also has a nice nightlight built in and that's handy in a dark bathroom.
This hair dryer hangs in the wall in the bathroom so you have more room in your drawers. It works well, but needs to be replaced every few years after daily use. It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you.
Used this at a Hyatt Resort in CA.  I immediately bought one through Amazon on the stop.  works great ad is compact.
I love this nice looking hair dryer.  It's powerful, yet sized perfectly for home use.  I highly recommend this product.
Great product, lives up to its name, it is compact, lightweight, plenty of power.  I would recommend it to anyone that travels with a hairdryer.
my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!! fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp's that my other one didn't have.
Was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it! I have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy ... found what I was looking for. Thanks!
I bought this to replace the exact same model we had for the past 6 years. My wife had dropped our last one for the last time. It didn't stop working, but had so many cracks and was so loose, I was working she would electrocute herself sooner or later.<br /><br />Anyway, we/she liked it so much, we bought the same model.
I purchased this hair dryer for it's Ionic qualities.  I live in an extremely dry and often windy climate, and my hair tends to get fly-away very quickly.  After using this hair dryer only once, I noticed a great improvement in that my hair was no longer as fly away as before.  The dryer has great features, and does the job extremely well.
nice.
I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  Easy to use.
It works so nice and does not take up much space. We love it. The tow speed also is really nice
I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can't vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I've been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don't retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I've never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn't want to die just yet!
being a professional hairstylist i got so tired of expensive blowdryers that dont dry the hair any better than the cheap ones. THEN, i read the reviews for this dryer and again i thought, yeah right. SOOO, i bought it and i must say, this blow dryer rocks. it dries the hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! FINALLY, i found one that delivers on its promise
Excellent product!!!  It heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use.  This dryer would've cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place.
My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It's quiet, it's light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.
excellent the product<br />the goods came complete with all accessories in very good condition.<br />the dryer works great and is equal to the image that is published
This hair dryer is powerful and does s great and quick job of drying my hair after a shower. The price was right and it was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br />It is an excellent value for the money.
I bought this for my wife - in fact she didn't even know I got it for her until it arrived. The (now previous) unit she had was making me deaf - from halfway across the house!!  This is much, much quieter, and the frequencies it produces are not ear shattering. She hasn't complained, so maybe she was thinking the same or perhaps she just likes how it does her hair - she looks good to me!!.
I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it's great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it's the first dryer I've ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it's well worth the cost!
I wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores. This one fit the bill perfectly. Have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised. So far I am very please and happy with this product.
I'm in love with this dryer!! My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30. It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It's at a good price also.
Great Hairdryer with Twin Fans. Does make a scary screeching sound if the power drops. The Hair Dryer is not red, it is pink. also it does NOT have Ionic drying which is a good thing in my case.
I love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings, but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers. It folds in half, has a retractable cord, and is fairly light.
This is second time i've bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  It's powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  I love the recoil of cord.  Happy happy, for second time.  :)
I took one hair drier from my country. but it doesn't work because of .different voltages.<br /><br />so I had to buy a new one, then  I select it,  I got it in two days. it is so fast!<br /><br />It is perfect@!
I got this hairdryer for my daughter and after seeing the results had to get one for myself.  I have very curly hair that is always frizzy in summer so matter what products you use.  This is the only hairdryer that seems able to dry my hair (in hundred plus degree summer heat and humidity) and keep away the frizz.  Best investment every.
We visit my brother in another state for several weeks at a time and we keep items there so we do not need to lug them back and forth when traveling there. We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply. This hair dryer fit the bill. IT IS RATHER LARGE. But it does fold up and the cord does retract. Despite its size, it still fits the bin that we use to keep our stuff there. It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair. The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean.
first the price is really good. I've used it frequently several months and it works well. a little loud but just as most dryers
Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.
I had one like this for about 8 years. Even though it still works I figured I should retire it as an extra or back up. I searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one. I googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck I found the exact same hair dryer that I loved for all those years. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and the great product.
I like this dryer. Compared to its price, it's worthy and both simple and useful. The shape and its power are impressive.
Excellent... A++.+.+.++++++.  It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull. Thanks
After buying cheap, but high watt  dryers for years, I am a convert. This has cut my drying time in half.
While this is bigger than the very small dryer it replaced, it is a light weight at the other, drys hair in minutes, and overall is exactly what I wanted.  I read most of the reviews of this dryer and others before ordering.  I know Conair products are good and a good value.  I'm satisfied with this purchase in every way.
This hair dryer fills the bill to a tee.  It is small, but yet it performs just as well as the former larger unit.
She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one. She absolutely loves it. Its the only thing she uses.
My husband and I used this dryer at the Ritz-Carlton Naples!  We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!
I have curly, coarse hair.  This hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair.  I ordered two, just so that I would never be without it!  Love this product!
This is the second one I have had.  The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  I think I'll purchase another one to keep in my RV.
This is my second one in 8 years and I think it is great. This new one is for a new home.
This dries my hair very well, and doesn't cause any frizz. I have naturally thick, long, curly hair, so whenever I decide to straighten my hair, I need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened (I use a flat-iron after I am done drying). The concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly-away hair (I also use One N' Only argan oil to help control frizz). I use the diffuser whenever I want to dry my curls, and I love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying.<br /><br />This purchase was definitely worth it!
It does exactly what its supposed to. Perfectly dries your hair in no time!<br />Fast and furious ,no frizz love it
My wife likes it very much. It's better than the last one she has that got too hot.<br />Thanks,<br />Jim
This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go
wow. she is awesome woman say that it doesn't take long to dry there hair. I need to order one more for my daughter.
This is a great product! The instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up! Def. recommend!
I bought this to replace another Remington that I'd used for a few years.  So far, I've been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I've had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I've never had one like that.  Can't say I care; it's just different.  Not better or worse.<br /><br />I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well.
The perfect dryer for travelers.  I owned a earlier version of this compact dryer from the mid 90s until 2013.  Used it everyday.  Extremely powerful for its size.  Would still be running if I hadn't plugged it into 220 volt outlet in Europe before flipping the switch from 110 to 220 volts.
Small hair dryer, perfect to put on you travel bag and use anywhere. Works perfectly. I recommend this product to anyone
bought it when my other one broke. love it! i recommend everyone to use this product regardless of the hair type you have.
Used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that I searched online and found it at great price on Amazon.  Dryer is compact, dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot.  You have option of mounting on wall bracket or not.  I use as home dryer and also take with me for travel.  Great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers I have purchased in the past.
This is my second one. Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one. Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer. It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it! LOVE!!
I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!
I love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer.  No more tangled cord. Glad I bought hair dryer.
This blow dryer is light weight, easy to use and quiet.  I love it and it's a great buy for the money.
My last one burnt out after 3 years of use. Hope this one will last longer. It works very well especially when 3 people use it daily.
These are great.Our other got used so much , it finally quit. Reason 3 girls.enough said. so go buy one.
Just what I was looking for! Had one almost identical but fried it in Iceland. Shopped all the locals and could not find this really small size. Bought one with a folding handle thinking that would make it workable but not so. Found this one on Amazon and it is the perfect replacement. Blows like a fool and is small enough to pack.
I love Andis products. They all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair.<br />Also, their flat irons are great as well.
I have had the blow drier for almost a year.  I love it.  I shut the bathroom door because the light is a little bright however it is great for those middle of the night potty breaks.  It works great for me and I use it every day. One thing that I dont like however it could be because I dont know what I am doing.  Every time I go to use it I have to click the switch on the mount.  it does not automaticallyclick on when I pull it off then push the on on. I have to always click the switch.
This is the third wall mount I have purchased. L ove the convenience and that  I don't have to keep in a drawer.
Bought this for wife and sisters-in-law to use when visiting.  They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  Comes with each to attach and remove diffuser and concentrator attachments.
This hair dryer meets all my requirements.  It is compact, the cord stays out of the way the unit is reliable.
This blow dryer works great for me. I am African American with natural course hair. It has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so I don't have to use a straightener. But, when I do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully. I highly recommend this.
This is small enough to take on the road and is also small enough to keep at home.  The power is very good.
This is the third unit I've purchased.  They last two or three years.  It is very convenient and has a nightlight.
It's a good hair dryer, works great on all settings also a great price can't go wrong for the money.
I just received my dryer 7-19-2013 luv it.. I have thick hair and needed a blow dryer that can do the job this dryer straigthens my hair something kinda serious.. I would recommend it..
Love it love it love it.  The hair dryer with attachment works great and dries my hair fast.  Buying one for my sister
This product is geat pushes air fast and hot. three speeds to suit everyones needs. Light weight. not too bulky. Best blow drier i have ever used. Dries hair fast
My hairdresser recommended this dryer, I love it it drys fast and if I use a round brush, my hair comes out straight hardly have to use my flat Iron.
THIS IS MY 2ND. ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER.
I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!
This hair dryer is great. I have very thick hair and it dries my hair quickly. Very nice.  Good price too!
I'm very happy with the hair dryer.  I like a wall mount hair dryer so it is constantly out and available out and yet off the bathroom vanity.  I've had this for a while and have no complaints.  I didn't buy it for the nightlight but it's still working after being plugged in for 24 hours a day for awhile.
You can choose hot, warm, or cold air in high or low airflow. The long cord allows you to move freely.
I like simple, lightweight and efficient and this was perfect.  Like the lighter heat option for finer hair like mine.
This works very well.  Fits nicely in my hand.  Good for travel and / or  as your main hair dryer.
Although Ferrari is a car's brand it's been known for some decades specially because of the design it's cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier.<br /><br />It's said to have a professional quality and it DOES. The item works amazingly well and looks very beautiful so as you'll when using it.<br /><br />The hook on its base makes it easy to keep the cable together after the use. The unit is very compact and travel is quite easy as well.
It dries my hair with speed and leaves it with shine.  It is fairly compact and quieter than most dryers.
Very lightweight, easy to use.  Exactly what I needed.  The attachments and travel case were an added plus.  Perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design.
It was delivered within a few days and I really like it.  It was really nice to be able to hang the cord and get it off my counter.
My old hair dryer was a Conair 1875 that I purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises. So I figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer. I purchased this Conair 22NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one. It's light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair. It dries my hair in 1/2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer. It's a great product and you won't be disappointed.
This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  Really worth the amount spent.  Thank you!
Love it! Excellent product. Very good power as I expected since it is a professional product . I hope lasts forever as if used in a salon
It is wonderful. I have spent a lot more on my other hair dryers and this one is great. It is small, lightweight, and dries my hair in less time. I will recommend it to others and would buy it again.
Awesome product, pretty much as described. does exactly what it's supposed to do. If you want a good ceramic product, then this is it for you.
Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!
Not only am I happy with this hairdryer, but I've already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it. It has great power, is small enough to consider taking it when I travel, and was really reasonably priced. I hate to admit it, but it's better than the $150 Italian hairdryer that I was replacing.
Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don't expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.
Love it, very powerful for something that small. Wish it could fold up, but still it is an awesome product.
I really like this Conair hairdryer.  I've had it for several months and use it most every day.  It's easy to use, dries my hair quickly and I like that I can set the temperature and speed separately and that the cord retracts.
Great blow dryer. It does the trick and dries your hair quickly. I like the little 'Cold Shot' button as well.
Works great... Better than advertised! I would/have recomended this product to others and it works like a dream on my daughters hair too!
I was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer! I am not willing to spend $50 or more on a fancy hair dryer, so I hoped this one would be close enough. It works great - better than expected! Dries fast and gets plenty hot. It comes with several attachments which fit securely and don't fall off. Also love the miles-long cord so I can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair!
I bought this after my last Conair blow dryer pooped out.<br /><br />Pro: dries quickly, silky, smooth hair<br />Con: none yet
We're in the health care industry, often times after our patients undergo MRI and other brain imaging procedures, they need to shampoo their hair. This product is just right! Works fast!
I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it's the best ever!  It arrived so fast to my door and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  My hair actualy feels like silk..very smooth...  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!<br /><br />Thank you..<br />Linda<br />RI
This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!  We arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo.  These dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them.  Highly recommend this product!
I have used these little wall-hung hair dryers while on vacation and wondered if I would like one at home.  I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  I think I am drying my hair in HALF the time I previously took.  WHY didn't I buy this sooner???  :)
Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light. Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe. Very happy with the purchase.
A great dryer for me (I have arthritis), not heavy and does all I need for  drying and styling my hair. Bargain priced too.
I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend.
We were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us. It seems to be well built. Our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected. We will see how it holds up over time but as of right now I'm very hopeful.
This is a great hair dryer. It is quiet and has a powerful fan blower.  It has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed.<br />There is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on.  It has a long cord which<br />is nice.  It is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier. However, the heat and blower features and quietness<br />more than offset this.
My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It's light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!
I love this.  It's just what I wanted when I decided to buy a blowdryer.  Fast shipping, too.  Good buy.
Fabulous little blow dryer. Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!
A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???
I had no problems with this, it works; the diffuser was what I really wanted (the concentrator I haven't tried) and that works too.
This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy!
This is my second Blackbird.  I had the first one for 10 years before it gave out.  I have very thick hair and it takes about 20 minutes of drying to style and dry my hair.  I'm hoping I have this one as long as the first one.
A stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use.  It is lightweight, compared to what I had been using, is super powerful and does my hair faster.
Love this dryer.have been using the same kind for several years. Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.
I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  I don't agree at all; besides, I would not recommend ever leaving a blow-dryer plugged in all the time.  It's a great little dryer.  No more having to keep in a drawer, taking it out, putting it back, every time I want to use it.  It was a snap to put together and get on the wall.
I been using Conair hair dryers for years, but this one is the worst hair Dryer I ever used.  It burns your hair. I didn't have the box anymore, or I would have returned it.
This blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat - both make it great at styling my very curly hair.  It is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands, which makes maneuvering it easy.  I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment.
I love the size, power & settings! Also, the browdryer has a really nice look & is powerful too. I feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting, medium heat on the medium setting & low heat on the low setting. I also like the cool air button too. I'm Black with relaxed African american hair and it works just fine for me.
2000 watts makes a big difference in how quick n easy straightening your hair is. Perfect for coarser hair types.
I have fine & thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.
Just received The Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer and am very pleased with product. Dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before.<br />Would highly recommend!!!!!
This dryer is powerful but light weight and easy to handle.  The diffuser is large and the settings make styling easy.
This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with. It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast. It is also very cute!
We have a cabin in Tennessee that we use as our vacation home.  Half the time, we forget to take a hair dryer with us.  This has solved that problem.  The dryer has a long cord.  The cord hanger can be moved to either side when mounting but it probably isn't even needed.
My wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years. She was not impressed at all. Till our hair stylist receommended Elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away. She is very pleased.
I've been using this hair dryer for quite some time and have never been happier.  Wall mount keeps counters clear and I love the small size and light weight.  Thanks very much v/r Susan
I love it! Dries hair so fast! Very nice condition. Great I can remove filter and clean it! I think this will keep it working efficiently for longer!
I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.
I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. If you have straight, no-volume hair, this hair dryer is PERFECT. It gives me the only volume my hair will ever see. I have two houses and have one of these in each. My first one lasted me 4 years before I took it to Europe and all of the added voltage was too much. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out. Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall. Nice!!
This is a very small dryer but with a BIG punch!  I was shocked how much power this little dynamo has... I can dry my hair faster than I ever could with my larger hand held dryer.  It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...Highly recomended!
This is the second one of this model dryer- revlon travel 1875w I have purchased. I bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since I got it and it worked so well. I bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong! I have pretty thick long hair, about chest length, and this dryer is by far the best one I've ever had. I always bought Conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with. It ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big Conair, dries my hair super fast (5 minutes or so) and is really light. I dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much I use it and it still works like a charm. Revlon for me from now on.<br /><br />Summary- best little hair dryer you will buy. Powerful, light, and great value!
Low air on the first but the 2nd was great. It is in the guest bath so know one evr has to pack the monster blow dryer.
I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.
E eReally worth the money paid I'm happy with the product a must buy my top list loved it wow
Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good
I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel. It worked so good I ordered one as soon as I arrived home. I thought it would be really expensive but it is not.
Does it's job. Temperature settings are awesome. You won't regret buying it. I havent tried in any of the extra style dryer.
I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free. I do wish it had 3 settings instead of just the two. It is either hot or cold and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.
I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up and I needed to replace it... I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  But this one was perfect!!!  I didn't even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  Very happy.
worked great!!!!!!!!!!!!  better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10- 100$$$ this one is the best so far!!
So I was at a hotel over the weekend and they had one of these hair dryers.  I thought &#34;Wow!  This thing is quiet and powerful!  I need one.&#34;  Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old so it was due time.  For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  I'm one of those &#34;I hate washing my hair b/c it takes forever to dry&#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  It's heavier than my last one but who the heck cares because I don't lose hearing after use and I'm done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  So yeah... Clearly I recommend this. :)
This is a great product for home as well as hotel! I have one in each of my 3 bathrooms!!
I have frizzy and curly hair so it is hard to find a blow dryer than can straighten easily and quickly. This pro blow dryer definitely does the trick. It is strong and gets the job done.
Good and powerful. I think it is enough for boys and guys to dry their hair within 2 or 3 minutes.
Great price. It's a good brand, I did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings .i recommend . Others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less.
The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!
I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!
I got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews. I would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat, its either too hot or cool, but I still think it works great. I love it!
This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.
Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)
I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It's still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her's as I have had!
This is the only hairdryer I've ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free.
Long and heavy duty cord, powerful, great attachments, enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can't mistakenly hit them while you're drying.  Fees sturdy but not too heavy.  Good product for the buck.
Never heard of this brand before, but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so I ordered it from Amazon.  Really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair.  Highly recommend.
There aren't too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I've had the most success with. I just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets. I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &#34;back order&#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.
I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker
Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!
Handy & convenient.  Love the cord hanger, I use it to hang my flat iron.  Very good product for the cost.
This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &#34;latch&#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don't have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.
I bought this for traveling. I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry. This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.
I actually use this in the garage for drying glues, paints and finishes, replaced a unit I had for years, works great
I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!
I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.
I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.
Love it!  Lighter th!an I thought a dryer could be.  Lives up to it's reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time
I'm traveling to Europe and I need a hair dryer with diffuser. I really like it! is not heavy, easy to handle. Is hot but you can change it to a low temperature. Best part, voltage for US and Europe. Just love it! very cute!
Lightweight and compact but powerful.  Used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when I returned home. After years of using a hair dryer, this is myall time favorite.  I use it most every morning and love it.  Plus, it was reasonably priced.
This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it's sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it's easy to handle.
This hair dryer is light and easy to use.  It met my expectations for drying medium length hair.  Very pleased.
Product was shipped promptly, is exactly as advertised. Not too much, not too little.....does the job to dry both my hair and my Chihuahua's after a bath.
I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer. It works! Other than that, it's pretty much your average hair dryer. I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located, but I expect I'll eventually adapt to that.
My wife used this brand she saw at Disney while on vacation last year, she liked it enough that she decided she wanted one like it. After searching Amazon I was surprised to find it and order one. Works well and wife is happy. Seems to have a stronger air output than more expensive brands.
I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &#34;full size&#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.
My dream hair dryer....great product.  This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  My hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the Andis 82005 Professional 1875 Watt Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer!!
I bought this because I could not use my Conair Infiniti pro hot brush when I travel to other country. Fortunately, this performs much better than the conair hot brush. Aside from providing me a good styled-hair, my hair also shines better after using this. This product is very durable, it shows on the design. I've been using this regularly for three months now.
We went out West traveling, I took this mini hair dryer. It worked great. It was small,but it worked better than my full size one at home. It didn't take up much room, and it was light. Would recommend this to anyone traveling . Perfect!
my wife is very happy with this purchase. I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality. I have found everyting to be as advertised or better. hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold. these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct. price was very reasonable. delivery was quick. product was received in pristine condition. I highly recommend this product and seller
Makes my hair shiny and soft.  I love this flat iron!  Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  I would highly recommend to anyone.
A hotel we recently stayed in had this hair dryer and I loved it so much, had to buy one when I got home.<br />Dries hair quickly and is nice and light too.
Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room. Has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely.  Also the retractable cord it great so you don't have alot of cord that you have to wind up. This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.
I felt this dryer was great for the money. It is not one of the best dryers out there but I felt it was sufficient in getting my hair dry in a short time period. I am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but I also didn't want to use a towel either. That's why I love this dryer. It is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget.
I ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw.I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change.<br />I really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i was so anxious to use it.Like my custom has always been, i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts!I was so dissappointed...i have not been able to use the product since i received it.<br />My question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts.I would really love to.
Brought this to Thailand. Although there were blow dryers in the rooms, i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. This is awesome! Compact and worked great. Just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet!
My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don't think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet.
I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  If you're short like me (5'2&#34;), you can't just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested.
I really love this hair dryer. My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly. I wanted one that was quiet and dry well. I have an Onei flat iron that I'm very happy with so I was happy to buy the hair dryer. I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well. I am happy with my purchase.
Wife loves it as does my Daughter. Bought another one for her.<br />Fast Drying With out the FRizzzzz..!! Light and easy to hold.<br />Great Price, Fast Ship. Great Product.
I was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly. I would recommend!
My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it. So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Onei MK_ll, a different brand than my daughters.  I loved it the first time  I used it.  I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine.<br />My daughter tried it when she came to visit and, of course, loved it!! So--I bought her one, too.  She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.<br />The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  No problems.
I bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and I needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to Europe. It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can't vouch for its durability. At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it.
I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer. I thought there are no difference between $30 dryer and $70 dryer. This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made. I got it for two weeks now so far so good!
This is my third Andis Hangup Pro Turbo Hair Dryer of this model over the past 15 years or so. My husband and I use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access. Product is very reliable. Must keep dust screen in back of handheld unit clean. It is very easy to clean as it unscrews. Wall mount has a reset button if unit shuts down due to overheating which doesn't usually occur if screen is kept clean. Would purchase another of this product when needed.
Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that feels good to hold in your hand.
This is a a wonderful dryer, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Why didn't I buy it earlier?
After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It lasted a good long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn't even see what else was out there, which I never do - I'm the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It's quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended.
The dryer is quiet and powerful. There are three heat speed settings and one without heat. The dryer has silky-touch surface for smooth handling. We have used Andis hair dryers for years. They are used in upscale hotels.
This is a great product.  I didn't really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I'd say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!
excellent my clients love the way theirs hair look and so fare the best investment that I made this year
I got this for my daughter cause i have one and she loved it...it got here fast and in perfect condition...she loves it...loves the power.
Love the dryer. A funny thing though. I have short hair and the attachment that fluff's up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet. I am afraid I will knock  myself out. My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it. Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.
I'm happy with this product. I have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry. This makes it easier and faster to dry my hair. I'm very satisfied with the Andis Dryer.
This product got fast in a new not opened package with instructions and everything, it is usefull and very light i love it!
I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands.
This dryer is a great device and works well. It's small and can easily be transported while travelling. It's also powerful and helps to dry hair out.
I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.
I needed a basic, reliable hair dryer.  That is what I got, and I did not over-pay for it.<br /><br />The option for air-only is convenient - in a pinch I was able to dry out a nearly-ruined paycheck without damaging it.
This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn't bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it has good heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &#34;stylish&#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature!
I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!
I love this hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord.  The high speed is great!  I was surprised by how quiet it is.
I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &#34;too much&#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.
We liked this so much, we bought another for our daughter's bathroom so we could get ours back! Very quiet and a reasonable value. The wattage is fine because any higher just cooks your hair anyways..!  Time will tell with durability..
The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It's like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington.
I love this powerful light weight dryer. It leaves my hair shinny with lots of body. My granddaughter recommended it to me. She loves her dryer also.
No complaints. It's light and not too noisy. It has 2 blowing speeds and 2 levels of heating which is enough for me to adjust as I need. I am using it for the last 6 month with no problems so far. I got it thru Amazon and happy with it.
I put this in my gym bag and the features make this perfect with folding and retractable cord. Love it.
I would highly recommend this. It is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine. Good value for such a good product.
Works great @ just the right temp.  Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  Love the retractable cord!  Definitely the best dryer I've ever had and at a great price to boot!
Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can't go wrong. x
i use it to dry my hair.What a  stupid question or do you have other uses for a wall hanging hair dryer
I have very thick wavy hair, and this has been the best hair drier ever. I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends.
I bought this Conair when my old one finally blew.  After 10 year mind you.  I have short hair but need something with a couple heat and blow settings.  This does the trick.  There are two speed settings and three heat.  That gives you enough combinations to do the trick.  Takes me only 5 minutes to dry and style my hair.  It also has a &#34;cool&#34; button which is easy to reach.  The hook on the handle makes it easy to hang if you need to.
After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!
Once I used this hair dryer, I noticed how quickly, efficiently and with less noise dried my hair.  I can definitely see a difference with the efficiency when compared to hotel and hair dryers sold at a local drug store.<br /><br />The delivery of the dryer was as promised, delivered promptly.<br /><br />I would recommed this vendor and product to my friends.
I recently bought the HSI flat iron.  I liked it so much I bought the dryer.  I like the dryer just a much.  It is light weight and powerful.  I have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz.
This is a wonderful product. I like how it has a &#34;coo/warm/hot&#34; switch AND a &#34;low/high&#34; switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high. I also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair. I would definitely buy this product again.
Definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time. I love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it.
Love this blowdryer!  Compact, yet powerful!<br />Typically I can't find anything that blows the air strong enough, this is by far the best dryer I have had.
This hair dryer is powerful, quiet by hair dryer standards, and has a solid quality feel to it.  I spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase.
Arrived in time. I've only had it for one month so I'm not sure how long it will last but so far I've had no problems. This hair dryer is great. I'm not sure if it is as good as the more expensive brands as I have never paid over $20 for one but it definitely gets the job done. Oh and I looove the retractable cord.
Great dryer if you don't like the newer types which have gadgets added to them and are very powerful.  This has a powerful setting but not extremely strong so that your hair is getting a beating.
I love it, my hair is so shiny! it dries faster and I love the attachments, I use the diffuser for my curly hair and the other for my daughters' straight hair, all around great product.
oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don't think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased.
this does what you think it will, dries hair. My wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time.
Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!! Great value for the money.  I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.
NO complaints here! I say buy this one . Its a great hairdryer. and I go thru them. SO good product!!
This is a great dryer.  The three settings, low, medium and high allow for more flexibility when styling your hair.  My hair  is fine so the low and  medium setting work great for me!
this hair dryer was worth the money. The quality is good without breaking the wallet. Also, the size is optimal, very small, easy to handle and operate.
Ordered it online as ssonas I returned.  I love the retractable feature. It is the best hair dryer I've ever had.
I bought this for my daughter 5 months ago. She loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me. It dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel. I am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one.
Great price, great item. She loves it. This is professional quality , she uses it at home and for work as well.
I really like that the cord retracts.  Good force of air.  Nice that you can change speeds and/or heat settings.  I like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button.  Slightly heavier than I would like but not unreasonably so.
I love this little hairdryer.....travels well, small, and lightweight.  It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  Has 2 settings for temp.  Good value and easy to handle.
I am in hotel industry - I could buy thousands of these. Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I've never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it's obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.
I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  I live in California.  This neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon. and it onlytakes 15 minutes and I can do it my PJ's instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what I can do for a few bucks.
Hey All,<br />I am not so blessed with fine, thin hair that unless its pinned up and perfectly coifed its a frizzy, fly away mess.  This hair dryer changed that! With its settings and cool air, I can dry it and leave it. No more constant pinned up hair. I can let my locks down! SO yes. I highly recommend it. Its not perfect, Its a little bulky and takes some getting used too (you might have to change how you dry your hair) And I don't recommend traveling with it. BUT for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm, has easy to use settings I love it -So much that I sent one to my sister :)
This Hair Dryer has a nice color, and has been working so good.<br />So far so good!!!<br />The turbo velocity is quick drying. Is comfortable to use and easy to handling.
For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling! I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful. Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!
Having used numerous blow dryers in my business, I have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons. It's lightweight and I can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed...love the design! I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.
I just love my Conair 1875 Blow Dryer.  It's more powerful than any blow dryer that I've ever purchased.  I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  And it's great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  I happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available.
Works well for my wife, it's not fancy, but it does the job well. If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, this is the one.
Andis makes a great product, and I have a white Andis full-sized dryer for the house, but I needed a smaller one for on-the-road travel in my semi truck. This also has dual voltage for overseas travel, so YAY! Get one.
The dual wattage feature saves you from having to use a converter. The unit is very small yet plenty powerful, and way better than the dryers provided in hotels. For my hairstyle, the air concentrator attachment is a must. I'm very pleased with this dryer.
Salon quality dryer.  Great size and color. Love that its so quite. I've had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one was on the inside) but it's well worth it.  My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings.. Love it, Love it, Love it.<br />I would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer. Four year warranty. Where can you find that on a hair dryer?
I used the 'soft touch' black version of this hair dryer at a high-end resort hotel once and I was immediately in love, so I had to get this (white) one on Amazon. It had so much power for such a small dryer!! Highly recommended.
Love how quiet this dryer is.  It feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.  Other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer!
great product I recommend everyone get one. It is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with, you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap.
it does a good job in a short amount of time and that it exactly why i bought this.  good dryer
Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it! You don't have to worry where to put it, it's on the wall!
I have thick curly hair that I straighten twice a week. This hair dryer makes it easy! I highly recommend it!
Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one. Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast
I truly don't understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers.  It's fantastic.  The settings, noise level, weight, what it does to my hair - all of it.  It's great.
I cannot believe I spent this much on a hairdryer, but I do really like it much better than the one I got at the large chain store. Wish it cost less, but would probably buy it again... ( :
I received this product and am very happy with it.  It is so powerful that even with my very think hair, it is dry within minutes.  By far the best product I own for drying my hair.
This was purchased to replace the one that got stomped (by accident). It is of a very professional quality, without the high price tag.
Great hairdryer the wife is very happy. I went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular
I LOVE IT!!! IT IS JUST PERFECT. MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE IN LOVE WITH IT. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%
I don't use my hair dryer for much more than drying purposes... Lol... It's simple, in-expensive, and it blows a lot of hot air... ;)<br /><br />It serves its purpose well...
I hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer, and I am so happy I did.  I have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it- my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer!
Loved the color, works amazingly well. Dries your hair very fast. I love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed
I am a hairstylist, and I love this dryer! It is lightweight, and it dries my hair incredibly fast. The cord is a little short for professional use, but I love it for myself!
this hairdryer is a super product!  i would recommend this item to everyone! it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes..
This hair dryer replaced one my Mom had been using for the past 25 years or so. I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  She is delighted with this Conair HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.
This was perfect for my trip.  Even when I did not realize I had to turn the dial to a different voltage in Singapore - it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer.  When I was finally smart enough to realize I needed to select the voltage I could not have been happier.  I have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times.  I hate when my hair gets caught in the fan.  This dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled.  It folds up for easy packing too.
I am very happy with this hair dryer. I must agree with others, though, the night light is very bright. I read other reviewers who said it was bright, but I couldn't imagine such a small light being so bright. My dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom. I covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright. I like having the night light, but it could be a &#34;bit&#34; dimmer. The dryer works fine and I like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn't lay on the sink. That is a great feature.
Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year. I've only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far. Make sure if you're Australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don't put it on high! I didn't read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha. Can only be used on low here, but that's fine as it's for my trip to the US anyways. Was quite powerful and I think it'll be perfect.
I use this hairdryer 3-4 times a week. Great power and is quite nice...plus it's in my favorite color, red.
I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  Wal Mart no longer carries this dryer.  This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  That is why I keep buying the Vidal Sassoon Ion dryer.
Its good, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!
I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It's very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it's better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don't have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.
I first used this hair dryer at a friend's cabin and I was hooked. The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part? It gets super hot. You can barely hold your hand under it for too long. I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!<br /><br />The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!<br /><br />I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair.
My wife used it at a hotel for several days and wanted one for home use.  It met and exceeded her expectations
I purchased this hairdryer because it's the one my beautician uses !I LOVED how fast it was to blowdry my hair !!I got the travel one too !! LOVE IT LOVE !! FAST SHIPPING TOO !! THANK YOU !!
I LOVE this hair dryer! I bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a Marriott hotel. It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can't beat that! It is light and love the retractible cord. After a while you have to push the cord in yourself but I've had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable. I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product, this is it!
After 8 years this dryer finally became brittle and began chipping near the fan so it was time for a new one.  I had no reservations  buying this same make & model..matter of fact I bought two this time....one will stay in the luggage ready to hit the road.
works great for me, i dont need anything fancy but this one has everything i needed. the attachments help for random things as well
Dries my thick hair in no time.  I love it and wish I would have bought it sooner.  It's worth the money.
This does exactly what I need it to, it's really quiet which is nice, but still does it's job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I'm please with this purchase. It doesn't get too hot like other dryers I haven't had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long.
This is one of the best blow dryers we have purchased.  I am going to buy another one to keep in our travel bag.
Works as advertised.  Can't beat the price for a quality product such as this one.  One of the better buys out there.
It has a lot of power.  Easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip
The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using! The heat setting are great too... I like the option of having cool, warm and hot... the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time. And the retractable cord is great! I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend!
ive always really liked the travel sized blow dryers. and this one is wonderful not to heavy and drys my hair in half the time.
My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.
Googled hair dryer, found it at Amazon.com one of my trusted sites. Ordered it and got it 4 days ago. It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in. Great Product. Working fine.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Amazon
I love the blow dryer it works great. it was a little heavier than I thought it would be but is great.
Product arrived as expected and was a bargain price. I just used it for the first time and am very happy with purchase. I kept it on low setting, which was enough for my hair. The cooling button works fast to cool off curls created by your brush. Would highly recommend item.
Best hair dryer I have ever used!  I bought it b/c I used it at a hotel and I love it!  I have had it for about a month and it works great.  It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn't damage my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair,!
Works great and my little girl loves having her own blow dryer! It is a very cute and functional blow dryer!
Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers. Hotel style - very convenient.
Oozes quality. Easy to maneuver to any direction. Relatively quiet and extra long cord. i really have been spoiled by it!
This product was worth every penny! It will work for any hair type and saves so much time. There's nothing better than not having to use your arms while drying your hair. The ionic button is the best feature, which helps prevent all frizz :)))
I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you're round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it.
The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  I got the regular and travel size.  Love them both.
this is a great product I would recommend it to all my friends that own salon it's easy it's lightweight and it last
shonnila<br />Excellent Product at an Excellent Price! The first time I used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish.....Love it!
This is a great dryer. As a male, I don't use all the &#34;fancy&#34; options that this hair dryer comes with. I simply use it for 30 seconds after I come out of the shower and it works great. The two selling points that I bought this dryer is because of Amazon Prime and the low price compared to other hair dryers.
I never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers. Unbeknownst to me, I was sorely mistaken. This keeps the static out! And I admit that I have quite a mane of hair, and this drys it in record speeds. A lot of customization with temp/speed/air flow. Highly recommended.
This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it's very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a very good choice!
So my previous 1875 watt ionic dryer started making my hair frizzy and finally died on me. I was looking around for a new one and found that my favorite brand in hair products made a cute stylish hair dryer. It doesn't just look nice, it works amazing too. I love how it has a setting for hot and warm. I haven't had a hair dryer with that option yet. I also really like the switch, rather than a sliding one. I have no complaints and I highly recommend it. It dries quickly and I have no frizzies and my hair looks so much better with this dryer compared to my old Revlon. It's great for drying my curlies and works just as well for blowouts, too.
I bought this for my mom, who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine-textured hair. She loves this one! It dries her hair very fast and doesn't melt your hair like other blow dryers can. The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn't feel cheap. If you're in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.
Purchased this blow dryer based on a recommendation from my hair stylist. One of the best investments I've made in years. Powerful but light enough to maneuver easily. It doesn't weigh your arm down. Worth every penny.
I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I'm very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy...
I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you.
This hair dryer arrived in good time and worked as advertised. My wife loves that it hangs on the wall in our bathroom. She finds it very convenient. Would not hesitate to deal with this company again.
this is a very good hair dryer. It doesn't mess up my hair. Very good product. I would definitely recommend it.
Ok, so we all know that we can't pack a lot of heavy things.<br />This little dryer will save a lot of pounds and it works great.
This hair dryer is the best I've owned!  I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it... I'm very happy with my purchase and will tell all of my friends about it...
I moved to USA recently, and needed everything for my house. This dryer was a perfect combination of price and quality.
This blow dryer is very efficient. The retractable cords are convenient and I have no malfunctioning problems at all. The colour is bright and pretty. I think I got my money's worth.
I was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect! It has more features than I expected, based on the online description. I was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings, and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers I've purchased. I love it!
This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with.  Itdries your hair quickly too.  I don't need it on the highest setting for too long.  It came with a concentrator and a diffuser.
This hair dryer is awesome! I read many reviews about it online. And I am so glad I listened and bought this. You will not be sorry....it's great! It heats up, has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage.
As other reviewers said, it is light and quiet. These are two things that really impressed me. Plus it does a good job drying my hair.
I forgot to take my hairdryer with me when visiting a friend.  She had this dryer in her guest bathroom and after using it for a few times, I said:  this is the most wonderful little dryer -  I have to get one.  It is so powerful and makes drying not only quick but blows in lots of volume.  I bought one for my home in FL and a second one to take home to my MI home this summer.  I was so happy to locate it so easily by just going to Amazon!
I discovered this while on vacation recently.  All of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests.  It's light weight, fairly quiet, and the variable temperatures sold me.  It also has a cool button which is fantastic when it's hot.  I actually ordered this from Amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when I returned.
It works with it's 3 settings, Hot Warm and Cool. It's also pretty strong and dries my hair quickly (I have long hair). I only wish it came with that angled head attachment so you can blow in a direction.
LOVE IT LEFT MY HAIR SOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL LIKE IN THE SALON<br />DOES NOT OVER HEAT<br />AND ITS SMALL LIGHTWEIGH POWERFUL BUT DONT LET THE SIZE AND WEIGHT MISGUIDE YOU ITS A POWERFUL THING LIKE A PLANE OR CAR OR BOAT....LOVE IT. I USE IT ON MY HAIR ON M MOMS HAIR ON MY COUSINS HAIR AND ON MY SISTERS HAIR AND ON MY 2 DOGS HAIR I WOULD USE IT ON MY DADS HAIR BUT HES BALD LOL LOVE IT.... GET IT ASAP YOU CANT GO WRONG
I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone, it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.<br />It does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers.
Arrived and works great - good power, great price, and arrived in the exact time frame and all intact - good buy.
I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway.
bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does but they all end up going out. this Andis 8200 hair dryer has hung in there and it still works great. i would highly recommend it. its also very pretty in person, the color is great.
Love this dryer! I have very thick, unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny. It's not heavy at all and I haven't had any problems with it overheating or shorting out (sounds like operator errors to me). Definitely worth the money and the wait.
Works extremely well. Dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer. I recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand. It's a great deal!!!!
We have had numerous hair dryers, this is def. one of the best. Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far. Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around.
I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair. Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both. Great product for the value and I like the color. The retractable cord is a big plus too.
I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  I love it!  The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  I'm hoping it will last as long as my last one!
No problems and drys my hair well. There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great. The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot. The shipment was really a big surprise. I received this product within two days time from ordering it.
I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power. I was glad to have the voltage change switch.
my twin sister loved it she need one so i gave it to her as a gift,thanks i would give it as gifts
I battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer, and I'm so glad that I did. Twice I have used it to blow out my hair and my thin, fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener, NO fly aways.  When I decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly, I was hesitant because my Conair would leave my hair super frizzy.  Not with the T3, I had beautiful curls, frizz-free.  Don't let the lighter air flow throw you, this little baby has lots of drying power.  Great size, lightweight, and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away.
I love this blow dryer! I was hesitant to spend more than $20, but so glad I did! I have naturally curly hair and I notice my hair is way less frizzy! I did not notice it being heavy at all. Seemed same weight as my old blow dryer. The noise is about average. I wouldn't say it is quiet, but it's not too loud either. About the same as any other hair dryer I've used.
Drys my hair quickly. My hair is thick this dryer cuts my time in half. I would recommend it for anyone.
super sleek looking.<br />works great!<br />cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.<br /><br />good investment
es practico y bueno... encantada con el producto desde vargas venezuela<br />se los recomiendo.. el producto llego en buen estado
this was recommended by my hairdresser and it is all I expected.  It dries my hair!!!  faster and most likely won't konk out in a few years.
In the days when I had hair to blow dry,most handhelds just either were too hot,or just plain sucked. I got this for my wife and she has beautiful thick hair,if she's happy with it,it's a winner!
we purchased these after using in a hotel.<br />great and compact.<br />just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.
This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn't have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!
I LOVE this blow dryer. It really is quieter than any other one I've owned. The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.<br /><br />I love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it's really lightweight. You don't feel like your arm is going to fall off while drying your hair. It's also pretty quick. I have thick, straight hair that goes halfway down my back, and it takes around 10 minutes to dry.
I only wish that I had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out...my hair drys in more than half of the time faster....excellent product...
I used one of these hair dryers at a hotel back in 2008 and when we returned from our trip I immediately ordered 2. I recently dropped the original one and broke it so had to get the backup second one I had ordered out to use. Then I ordered another back up just in case. I have been caught short before (by different brands) and had to go to an event with wet hair. That will never happen again since I always keep a backup now.<br />Gets the job done and it is a nice light dryer, packs easy. Just love these. Never stop carrying them, please!
I use it everyday. It works great. No problems. Good Price. I got one for every bathroom.  Good power. easy buy.
Love this hair dryer.  Everything as described.  Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!
After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.<br /><br />Get it, you'll love it, really I promise.
My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.
we have a tiny bathroom with no storage.this hair dryer is so perfect.it's out of the way when not in use.does not take up drawer space.even has a night light.
Good power with very low noise.  Robust design.  The Night light does the job well. The dryer was easy to install.
Perfect hair dryer, does the job. Comes with 2 add-on's for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight. The retractable cord is a space-saver life-saver!
I saw this in People Style and wanted to try it.  I have long thick hair and it cut my drying time in half.  It's perfect and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.
This hair dryer works really fast on Turbo and my hair feels very soft when it's dry.  I really like it!
My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer.
This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product.
Have been using the yellow bird dryer for a least 20 years.  It's the best blow dryer on the market bt conair
I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.
I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance.
Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it's because it has tons (and I mean tons!) of power, which you can easily control so you don't burn your hair. The cord can be &#34;sucked in&#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away. Beautiful!
During our last vacation, one of the hotels had this dryer.  I loved how different it was and how my hair looked after using it.  I wrote down the name and model number.  When I came home, I looked it up and bought one.<br /><br />I didn't think one dryer was different from another.  I was wrong.  I use this every day and it doesn't disappoint.
This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far. I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!
This Conair 1875 watt turbo style dryer really does do a great job ob drying my hair. Very quick and efficient.
this product is excellent, good quality, durable excellent presentation. I had no problems even with quality. thanks you for it
I LOVEDD MY BLOWDRYER .I ALWAYS BEEN USEING TWINTURBO  BLOWDRYER BUT I LOVE HOW LIGHT THIS IS AND EVEN MORE POWERFUL.
I love this hair dryer.  It has great power and capabilities.  Much better than anything I've found in drug stores.
I was never a fan of blow dryers but this one was awesome.I didn't like the attachment that accompanied the blow dryer but overall it works and i like it.I recommend it.
love this blow dryer had the red one before but the wiring was cut.. this one is stronger<br />works great... good price
Very easy to mount. Even easier to use. The unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle. No need to spend money on higher priced units. Very nice product
works wonderful. gets hot and drys very fast. shipped fast, Would buy another one if I had to. If you need heat to your hair you wont go wrong purchasing this item.
Does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it.  Shipping was quick and product was in good condition.  Would recommend this hair dryer.
I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.
This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer
But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide.
I've been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  There's a reason I keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4-5 yrs of constant use.  The nightlight is perfect for the master bath.  Now we don't wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.
Have had it for about 2 years. Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price. All things considered it is a great product.
My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall. I bought us one and am sure glad I did. It's nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it. Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes. They like theirs also.<br />Would highly recommend.
The hairdryer works just as it was described.  It is small and compact, so it's much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long, thick hair (I have long, very thick, dry and damaged hair).<br /><br />I would also like to say that I will be a faithful Amazon customer for any products I need and Amazon carries.  I was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke.  I contacted Amazon and, without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke, Amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days!  I am extremely impressed with Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I really appreciate your customer service.
That's what I needed! It's fixed on the wall and always ready to be used! Very convenient and efficient! Great!
It takes a long time to dry very long, thick hair like mine, so a dryer with a heavy duty AC motor is a must.  It might be a bit heavy, but it works well and should last a while.
I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.<br />I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!<br />My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!<br />So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.<br /> Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.<br />I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!<br />Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.<br />So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer.
We use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall. Liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms.
so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!
Was exactly what I was needing. Girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these. The turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model
My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn't dry her hair out in the process), so that's it.  Highly recommend!
I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn't.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!
Does not dry out my thick, coarse hair. Hair is softer, more manageable, and more conditioned compared to a standard hair dryer. Highly recommended!
Living in the South, humidity takes it's toll on my hair so I was excited to visit Vegas where I'd heard there's &#34;no humidity.&#34; I planned to use the hotel's hair dryer (MGM) to lighten the packing. The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn't let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn't understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!) I still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
Well, I had a Turbo 1500 for a long time until it died. Then I made my research and found this new and powerful version of Twin Turbo 3500. So, I wanted ti invest in something good. I do my own hair at home, and my hair is curly. I finished to dry my hair so fast. I just  love this Twin Turbo 3500 and it worth the $$$.
I have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn. I'm happy to have given it a try. Keeper.
enjoyed this dryer for many cruises and wanted my own, Have not been disappointed!!  Powerful and tiny, delivers as promised
This is the second of this product that I have owned.  The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so I ordered another just like it.  Works great.  I don't have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day.  I highly recommend it.
I looked everywhere for a dryer to meet my needs. This one is just exactily what I needed and wanted.
My wife is happy with it, that's all I needed! Seems to work fine, and I noticed it's not as loud and annoying as some other one's my wife had before!
This is the seocnd one of these I have owned and the first lasted over 10 years.  Gret product, glad I could find it again on Amazon.<br />The mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have.  LOVE IT!!!
This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!
One of those...saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my GF a few years back...I thought more of it than she did (primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter, the better).<br />That's what she thought, too (that I bought this as a 'message')...which is why she's used it maybe three times in four years since I installed it there for her.<br />It's a great hair dryer (I let mine air-dry--my hair looks more like Michael Bolton's--or Fabio's--that way).<br />This little dryer still works great (I guess, I turn it on every once in awhile to check).<br />Yay, relationship issues!
I purchased thi dryer from Amazon based on reviews.  My wife loves it.  It is light and powerful.  A real professional hair dryer.  Subsequently I purchased on for my daughter, who also said she has never had one even close to this.  She said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor.  I plan to purchase one for my other two daughters.  A superior product.
This was a great purchase. The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected. It is so convenient to use every day. The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!
I have very dry hair and this little hairdryer works so quickly, I can already see an improvement.  My hair is less frizzy and much softer and shinier.
Yes, I love it.  It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast.
Lots of blow, lots of heat, and it is a light weight!  I have a bad shoulder and this thing is easy to use.  We even bought a second one.
Best hair dryer, definitely worth the money! Gets super hot, fast, making it so much easier to blow dry my hair since usually itll take an hour to dry but only takes about 15 minutes with this one!
I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.<br />1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.<br />2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.<br />3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.<br />4. Much quieter than my old dryer.<br />5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output.
I have thick and very long hair, and I have used so many different hair dryers in my life. But, none of the past hair dryers compare to this wonderful and efficient hair dryer. Now, I can blow dry my hair in half the time than before I had this hair dryer. I hope this hair dryer is never discontinued!
This product is very very good. I purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one. It is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome.
We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had. It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults. I have recommended this hair dryer to friends.
Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  Well worth the money.
LOVE IT, this is my third one.  great speed light weight.  only wish they lasted longer.  but for the price you can't go wrong
I recomend this Hair Dryer, It's small and works well, the Heat settings work well for fast Drying and Styling.  It's small enough to go with you on Trips, Or use at the house without taking up much Room.  Get one !
I chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews.  It performs well and is lightweight.  I highly recommend!
go o oo oo oo oo ooo o ooooo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo  oo oooo ooooo ooooooooooo oooooood
Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job. I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.
I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don't like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They're huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a 'cool' setting, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />If you travel a lot or if you just don't want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer.
Very good. We recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer.
A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful. Works even better than my full sized one. I use it at home too.
I'm a hairstylist. This dryer fit me like a glove. LOVE it. Concentrator attachment is nice and wide, and the dryer is really quiet, not heavy at ALL. Highly recommend.
I really can't rate this one, because it was a x-mas gift, but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one, so I guess she loves it.
excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor
This dryer is very nice, and my wife is completely satisfied.  On the other hand, I liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer.  We didn't have to dim the light on the old one, but this one is very bright and I had to tape something over it to tone it down.  I used a piece of thick paper that I cut to exactly cover the light and it is OK now.<br />It's a very nice product and I think that we would order it again.
Love it. The controls are easy to use but do not get in your way.  It runs much quieter than other hair dryers I've used.
I bought this because it was cheap and I needed a hair dryer. It works really well and I will probably buy a 'back up' since I expect it will go 'belly up' before too long. It it only last another 6 months, I'll consider it money very well spent.
My hair dresser recommended this dryer.  She saId it would reduce frizzies.  It has and I am pleased.  I like the way it folds up for traveling.  I will get great use of it.
I have a coworker who whenever she comes in with blown straight hair, it looks like she got it professionally done. I was looking to upgrade my blow dryer, and this was her recommendation.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical because it's kind of expensive, but then I bit the bullet and got it. I LOVE it.<br /><br />I have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz. It used to take me close to an hour and a half to blow dry my hair, then smooth over it with a flat iron.<br /><br />This blower dryer cuts my total hair-doing time in half! And I just touch up with a straightener on low heat (around my face, the top/back of my head). I use one of the concentrator attachments that comes with it (I believe the middle one).<br /><br />Also, I didn't touch up with a straightener for a few days, and my blow out really lasted!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who wants a sleek and bouncy blow out.
bought this for my mom after i used her old one and decided it sucked big time. she said she likes it and uses it everyday. i have yet to use it but she was happy!
Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!
I love it.  Works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair.  Highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer.
It's noisy.  I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)
Works good aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh ii jj kk ll mm nn oo pp qq rr
I bought one of these for traveling and my stepmom was visiting and she used it and loved it so much she wanted one for herself so I ordered her one as well! She  loves the power and it's lightweight.
It's been almost a year since I purchased this hair dryer and I love it.  I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  Works great!
Compact and light, but powerful for a travel hair dryer. We unplugged the hotel dryer and used this one because it worked better
I like this hair dryer. I just needed one quickly so I didn't really check it out. I just grabbed it and ran. It dries very well without burning your head off and that is an important thing. I don't want my hair burnt but I don't want to take a long time either. This one does both those things. I highly recommend it. I think you'll like it too.
Es un regalo para mi gorda bella la mas bella que Dios me ha regalado en esta vida la amo
Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon's #1 best selling hair dryer.
I've tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n' Hot (on  wheels & the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n' Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist who uses the commercial/industrial dryers at that salon, but at home, I use my Conair...works just as good!  Thanks Conair and Amazon!  Never stop making this product!...
I've always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  I actually use this everyday. Great buy and I would purchase again.
Exactly as described - so small!  When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  Just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  Doesn't weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  Great decision!
I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean. I love it
I am very happy with my new hair dryer. It drys my hair faster and does not heat it up so that it looks frizzy. I recommend this dryer. It is heavy but that is not a problem and the buttons are fine right where they are.
I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner.
It's a great simple hair dryer, works fine. 2 speeds, cooling blow button, that's it. Can't complain for the price. It's strong and light weight, easy to use. I don't need fancy $$ dryer.
This was my first Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer. I was looking for a hair dryer that would cut my drying time because I have thick hair. What a surprise, it did just that! It cut my drying time to a third of what it used to take with my old hair dryer. It proved to be as advertised. It made my hair smoother, shinier and less frizzy too!
We tried other brands after the first T3 died, but they never matched how well the T3 performed. My wife explicitly asked for another T3, got it, and she loves it.
Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!
This dryer if fantastic!  It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  Set-up is very easy.  There is great heat control from the top of the hood as well as the knob.  Easy to open and close
I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update.

What can I say? I didn't buy this for me bought it for the wife.  I haven't used a hair dryer since 1989.  She loves this one.
I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel I was staying in and loved it. After I got home, I went on line and found it at<br />Amazon for a really good price. It is small enough to pack in a suitcase without taking up much room. but heavy duty<br />enough to handle my thick hair. I love it.
Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  The color is a plus.
I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.
I have had this for over a year and it still works great<br />the cold button works fast<br />the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint
I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.
This dryer is compact, has a powerful fan and blows a lot of heat. My wife loves it. Not really quiet - like most dryers.
Really good hairdryer. Purchased this one after our other Conair (who's still going strong!) was just getting too old. Speeds are nice and it doesn't burn you like our other one did. Also surprisingly very light!
Despite the fact that it doesn't have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.<br /><br />I haven't used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it's wet haha- works like a charm!
I bought it for traveling but I use it all the time because it's powerful and lightweight. Definitely recommend the hair dryer and the seller.
I have no regrets about purchasing this hair drier. It does not frizz my hair at all and is easy and quick to use :)
I love the hot and cool settings. Does a great job overall, and I'm excited to try the diffuser it comes with
I used the one much more expensive than this before but it broke and I bought this. It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft. I'm very satisfied with it.
This dryer is compact and easily portable.  It does an excellent job of drying hair over event the largest curlers.
This is one of my wife's favorite presents.  It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag
I already have one like this, but I bought this one for my mother, and it's working better than mine. Thank you!
A great hairdryer at a great price. It's very quiet and powerful. Arrived very fast and I would recommend this product
Met all my expectations--small, compact, plenty of air, heat etc.  Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.
great  I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  I bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time.  thanks.
This is the best hair dryer ever,fast drying and easy to hold and use.  Our family has used them for<br />a number of years
I love this dryer. I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel. I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home. It was a little pricey but some things are just worth it. The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons. I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost. I would recommend the product and the seller.
This hair dryer is perfect for long hair.  It is easy to use.  I am very thankful I got it.
This hair dryer is amazing! It's light weight makes it easier to use. It dryers your hair super fast! I would definitely recommend it.
I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight.
We have had this for long long time, my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good, she dropped the other day, and still works very good.
Since I use this every day, it needs to be a good, reliable product. And that's exactly what it is.
It looks like it would be too small to be effective, but not so. This little gadget really blows, and in a good way. The dual-voltage aspect makes it good for international travel. Get one. You won't be disappointed.
I liked this hair dryer so much that when my old one finally died I bought another one. Some hair dryers are so loud they sound like a fighter jet taking off. This one is much quieter and is also quite light and easy to maneuver. You can't beat this for the price.
I use this to melt beeswax to help preserve leather.  It works perfectly.  It was cheap and it does what I needed it to do.
I like this item very much, easy to take and easy to control, that's exactly what I want to use in my daily life
This is probably the best hair dryer I've ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven't generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I'd have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn't take me an hour from start to finish!
I blow-dry my hair almost everyday-and it used to be a chore. This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  If you're thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer, invest in this one. It's half the price and totally worth it.
Good hair dryer for the money, seriously. I've had one just like it for almost 8 years, love it. So this one for less than $10 is awesome!
have everything i want,  go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d
This is the best darn hair dryer. My daugthter asked for her own dryer so I didn't want spend a lot of money on her first dryer. This works way better than mine and I spent 3 times more on mine. It dry's faster and isn't as loud as mine. It's smaller and lighter. I think I might just have to get me one of these also.
I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn't think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn't realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.<br /><br />The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you'd expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever owned a hair dryer I've liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby.
just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this
Awesome dryer! Handles well, dries the hair fast, very easy to control. The only negative...its a little heavy. Love it and would recommend it to all!
This hair drier is superb! it is small and powerful. It is great for home or travel. Best one I ever owned.
The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value.  Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way.  And as a bonus they hadn't changed the mounting system so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in.
This is the way to get a professional quality hair dryer at a fraction of the cost.  There are three or four brands selling essentially the same dryer including this one but none have the cord length of this one.<br /><br />Its performance is exactly as hoped and more.<br /><br />The cord is incredibly long, making plug concerns a thing of the past.<br /><br />We bought our second one recently.
I've always used KURUKURU and I'm glad I got it on Amazon because it works great for me right now. I don't know what I'd do without it!
I bought this because I just moved and have been using my sister's hair dryer up to this point. I couldn't afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.<br /><br />I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one. I really don't see the point.
If you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you're looking for. It gets very hot and I LOVE IT! It is good for my hair (I have very thick curly and frizzy).
I love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer - they are right, ionic technology does work!  I have no regrets buying this item.  It works as advertised!
I love the cooling blow drying feature. I don't have to spend hours to get my hair dry. A great buy!
I'm a professional hairdresser so I need a powerful blow dryer that's light. This serves the purpose it's powerful, light and hat. Six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do I guess there's nothing else to say.
The Ritz Carlton hotel provides these hair dryers. After staying at one of their hotels I loved the hair dryer so much I bought one.
This is great for me because i needed a new dependable hair dryer. Conair products are always a great to use
this was a great christmas present. the haet adjustment and cord extension were great, the gfci was a good addition and the color was cool.
I ordered this hair dryer when my hair dryer stopped working. I received it in just a couple of days. What I love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer. And the price is reasonable.
This small dryer really does its job.  I relied on other's reviews which were extremely helpful.  The most expensive product is not necessarily the best product, and this one proves it.  Great value.
Great dryer. Nice and light weight so my arms don't get worn out drying my long hair. Great power too.
I was a hair cutter for ten years back in the 80's.  Nothing has ever beaten the Yellowbird as far as power and design.
I use warm setting to dry and style and the cold setting to set. The product works great for my needs. I plan on using this for trips and a back up at home in case my other hair dryer quits working.
Replaced an old model with this.  It is faster, quieter, and lighter than it's predacessor.  Price the same as in stores,
nice size, color and not heavy weight. It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy. It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair. Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful . Very happy with that.
I was looking for a dryer with no heat option... Those that I have found before have the button that you have to press down in order to get the cool hair...This one is different you can totally dry your hair without using any heat at all because  you can just press cool air button and unless you change it you only use the ambiant air like a very powerful ventilator...
I stayed at a hotel in Chicago that used these in their room, and was so amazed by how much power comes out of this tiny little unit that I googled how much they cost, to learn that they are only around $25!  Now it's my go to travel dryer, and everybody is always so impressed with it.  I will be buying more, and I hope they never stop making these things!
Great bang for the buck!  My hair has never been happier.  I wish all purchases were so easy and I wholeheartedley recommend this product.
She is a lover of all things Hello Kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one.  Light weight and she still has her style and fun.
sorry I don't have anymore to say about it. It does what it's supposed to do. Okay? If you want reviews you're going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words.
dries fast, quiet, sleek. bought for my dad for christmas to replace an old remington he had that also had the dual motor. works very quickly and it very nice looking. lasts a long time too. my dad had his old remington for 6 years! lol it was time for an upgrade. im sure hell have this another 6... ha
This is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer.  I bought it because of it's dual voltage settings because I work internationally and will be traveling to Ireland soon.  I have been using it every day since I got it because I like it so much.
Dries hair in no time at all!  Great price great product.  Lightweight and fairly quiet.  I am hoping that this drier lasts many years, as did my last Conair dryer.
Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.
pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again
This is an amazing product. It leaves both hands free to do your hear. I have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months I have had this product. I am very pleased. This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.
I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.
I'm pretty lazy. I will avoid excess walking at most costs. My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white. Even if the cord isn't (that's actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery.... and now I have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb). I guess you can't have it all.
This hair dryer is great--it's lightweight and dries my hair in half the time of all other hair dryers I've used.
Thanks successfully received good product, I hope very soon make a new purchase with you. ...... .... .... .. .
If you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements.It is a good choice. You have different choices of heat. Anyway, it meets my requirement.
This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  My husband loves the sleek design and the compactability.
All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  I love the retractable cord and it's small, sleek size.  Great buy for the price!
I absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments, I usually buy CHI for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so I decided on trying Hot Tools and I was in love. Multiple settings so you can dry/style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer. I would definitely buy Hot Tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone.
My wife's blower was sounding like a tractor so we knew it was time.  Found this very inexpensive blower but ordered it because of the great ratings.  It's just the right size, has lot's of power and at $7.77, you can't beat the price.  She had purchased one for $30 at a local store before we found this one, but fortunately hadn't used it and was able to do a return.  One great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint.  Great deal.
Have used this for many years and can't live without it. Happy to have found it, will continue ordering it whenever needed.<br />Thanks.
As long as my wife loves it...I'm happy.  She loves red and finally she has one with all the features she desires in a hair dryer.
Can't complain about the quality of this product.  It's very much appreciated around here.  Everyone is using it to dry their hair.
This is a 1600 watt dryer with 2 fan speeds!  Heats up quick and is very handy mounted on the bathroom wall, which, was very easy to do with the supplied screws.
I am very happy with this dryer. I like the fact that it's light weight but does the job. Shipping was very fast. This will be great for traveling.
Just got it and works great so far but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  Not a lot of use.  Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  Will update later.
makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it
I have been using drugstore brand (revlon, clairol, etc) hair dryers for years.  Recently, I found that no matter what brand I bought, the heat would go from hot to cold and the dryer took forever to dry my hair.  I decided to upgrade to a higher end dryer and am so thankful I did.  This dryer cuts the drying time in half and my hair is not frizzy.  I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.<br /><br />The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it's also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn't be an issue anymore.<br /><br />I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  I won't ever go back to the &#34;cheapies&#34; again.
Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight. Its a little loud, but it puts out a lot of air so I guess that is to be expected.
This hair dryer has a good weight and feel. Solid consistant heat at different settings... A great buy at a great price.
Love the small but powerful size. Used virtually daily for 5 years and just wore out. I immediately ordered an identical replacement . No clutter on countertop, cord hanger, just a great unit.
We were looking for a replacement for our hair dryer that died. It needed to be powerful for long hair. This one does the job.
Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price! A welcome addition to my wife's beautiy gadgets.
This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  I was so impressed with it that I had to have one of my own.
Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.
Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.  They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.
I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.<br />I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two.
Great price for a great product. has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.
I've had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!
We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it's a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It's really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.
i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.
I have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. The night light is still on and works fine.
I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can't even remember the last one I wrote. However, I'm pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it's always been. It's not frizzy, so I'm not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I'm finished.<br /><br />Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I'm pretty sure this is the best purchase I've made in years.
I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel.
I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.
Do not underestimate the size of this dryer. My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can't beat that. What more could you ask for.
Great product. It dries my hair super fast. A friend of mine has had hers for years and I am hoping to as well!
I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don't have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings. If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I've got to say this is not a portable hair dryer.
Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &#34;head&#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!
Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!
This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.
Great product.  My Daughter uses it everyday, this was a christmas gift and it's getting used, holding up just fine.  Shipment was fast and packaging was great.
I bought it because it's not very expensive and free shipping. It's very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can't fold it.
I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.<br />My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end
The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel
Well the subject sais it all.  I scored big on this.  I bought it because of the reviews and I hit the jackpot.  My wife spent at least 15 minutes drying her hair each day.  My daughter has reached the age of needing to dry her hair each day so sharing the $20 target special had become a real hassle.<br /><br />The first morning my wife used it she was simply amazed how well it did.  She thought it might be a little hot for my daughter (age 11) but she was not sure.  We just gave her the cheap hair dryer and my wife is using this one.  I assume this will hold up well over time.  If we have any mechanical problems or anything negative develops then I will edit this review and add the updated information.  I give it 2 thumbs up!
I love this hair dryer so much that I purchased two more to give to my daughters for Xmas. It is the most powerful hair dryer available with 2000 watts.  It's a professional dryer with a low price.
I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm
I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.
This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &#34;overcook&#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &#34;cool shot of air&#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend.
The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.<br /><br />Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn't blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.<br /><br />Can't write about the long-term reliability, because I've only had it for a couple of weeks. So far, so good.
The hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one.<br />This hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one!
I was actually surprised.  My hairdresser recommended a home unit since I like to sit under her hairdryer and read.  A great treat at home!
It is easy to use and works great.  I have been using since it came and It works as described.
Fast blow drying,travel size, lightweight and great price. What more could I need? I am a  professional hair stylist, but I use this for personal drying. Works or me!
Even better than the Revlon version i had before. Controls are easier to use and it isn't too heavy in my hands.
This is typical hair drier I saw all the time at my fitness center, nothing fancy but a work horse, it works fine, and it's reliable, that's all I was looking for.
i have owned a few of these before, same style and model. they are very dependable. i love having them mounted on the wall in the bathroom.
It makes my hair straight. I love it. The smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it. Strong and powerful.
Best hair dryer ever. It reduces my drying time from almost 1 hour 30 minutes to just 45 minutes, eliminating all frizz.
This hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer. The retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button.
It is tiny little thing. Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer. Definitely recommend it.
I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  I have curly hair and it does not make it frizz.  Love it!
Great product. Arrived on Time as it said it would no complaints + ) = ) =0 =) = )
I typically don't use hair dryers, but I initially bought this product because I was sick and tired of my hair being wet when I left for work (especially during winter).<br /><br />My wife used this one time and loved it so much, that she has now started to use it herself! One day, she used her old one (I guess to compare power and dry time) and it now seems incredibly weak.  My caution is that this hair dryer will become the standard by which you judge all other dryers!<br /><br />*Important note: For those of you who buy this and don't typically use hair dryers, there is no directions that tell you that the &#34;fan button&#34; has to be turned on, AND THEN the heat button.  The heat button does not start it by itself.
I had similar 1875W Revlon before, this one is slightly smaller. The air blow out got the same feeling and speed of heating up. For a hair dryer, it works ...
This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won't slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.
I have used this dryer several times.  I like the settings and also the fact that it isn't too heavy for it's size.  Also, the price was right and it had other good reviews.
This hair dryer seems to work well for all hair types. It blows hot and helps with coarse or unruly hair types.
When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds. The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture. The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.<br /><br />This newer model works the same and looks the same. It just doesn't fold. The folding one is actually, IMHO, easier to bring when traveling.
LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. The heat control is amazing! Dries my VERY curly hair extremely fast & leaves it soft and shiny. A must have!
I put this in a rental condo and it is terrific. The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit.
Great for at home or salon used! I gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer!
IT WORKS PERFECT.  it is a really cheap product. It is lake a professional hair dryer, with AC motor, 2200 W and tourmalina.
I have wavy hair and had pretty much given up trying to get it straight on a regular basis  When I use this dryer it not only gets straight, but stays that way for the day.  Now I can at least approximate the look I have coming out of a salon - love it!
Easy to use. It is quiet and soft. Not burn your hair. Cool dryer option is also great to use.
WORKS WELL AND THE COLOR IS BETTER THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  DEFINITELY A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She's a stylist, so I took a chance that she wouldn't like it, but she loved it and replaced her old hairdryer with this one.
The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.<br /><br />Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look.
I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!
Used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.
I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don't feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks.
i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying :-D it works wonders :-)
Christmas present. Wife is pleased. What more can I say? It seems like a well made quality item. Nuff' said.
My daughter-in-law picked this gift to her wish list for Christmas, we bought it, and it is working very well.
Just get it! O_O that's how good it is.... no words can explain how well this thing works. I love mine! Had my eyes on it for years now and now that I have it.....I'm very pleased and glad that I bought it.
works great  but there is too much noise, i bought it for my girl friend and she loves it very much.
I love this hair dryer.  It drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle
IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IS UP AND OUT OT THE WAY~IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS  OFF WHICH IS GREAT AWESOME
I bought this for a friend for Christmas. SHe really likes it because it very light and the temperature controls move easily.
Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  you can take it anywhere in that house I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. â?1/26/2013
I love it and Use is very convenient<br /> This product is valuable, and the price is not expensive, worth buying!
We have four of these now. They are great product and work as described. Would recommend to friends. Would order again.
This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders. It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses.
I love this blow dryer! I was tired of taking 5 minutes to blow dry my thick hair so I went on a search for something that would be faster. So many say they blow dry faster but this one really does. So glad I purchased this. I no longer dread blow drying!
light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs.
Excellent dryer easy to put together, controls are awesome,all you need is one tool included with the dryer.<br /><br />Roy, Woodbridge, VA
While staying in a motel I used this and fell in love! My hair comes out smoother.. love the multiple settings.. this works so well I purchased a second for when my new one wears out!!! Good blow dryers are hard to come by.
Works great, stylish and is a great gift for anybody who tends to take care of their hair a lot. Package came right on time, in good condition and holds its worth.
Great hairdryer! I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  She wanted the Ion tool so it was perfect for her. Thanks.
hari dryer was exactly as described . very quick delivery for xmas runs grevery happyat would recomend for purchase very happy
This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.
i bought the &#34;used&#34;/open box item - no idea what was wrong with it - it looked like i got it off of the store shelf.
Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent
I purchased this dryer for my wife. She loves how quickly it works and leaves her hair feeling soft, and not static-free. It was a pre-Christmas gift, and here in Michigan the air is pretty dry this time of year, so I am officially impressed. There must be something to the whole ionic ceramic tourmaline thing.<br /><br />One of the minuscule clear rubber pieces in the handle dropped off when she took this dryer out of the box. It's not a critical component, but I hope it's not an indication of the dryers build quality and expected longevity. Given how the much less expensive, shortly lived, noisy, less effective dryers she has had in the past have been, I'm not too concerned though.
We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.
this product dries hair efficiently and quickly. It includes 2 heat settings and a cool boost button just like the more expensive models.
My daughter bought this hairdryer first and I kept borrowing hers. Finially decided to buy my own and I am very happy with the dryer. It is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer. Goes from hot to cold in seconds. I am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years.
I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway.
Works great. Exactly what I expected. Love the retractable cord, and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly.
This item arrived quickly and just as advertised. I love it.....it dries my thick hair in a flash. Try it!
It's absolutely amazing.  My wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair.  Worth the price.
This hairdryer is very nice, I have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes, I have also managed to drop it about 20 times since I got it and its still running like a  champ.
What I love about this is that it is fairly quiet, and yet seems to dry my hair quickly.  I especially like the concentrator, as it has a small opening and really works as I'm shaping my hair.  My hair is wavy, and I try to straighten it as I shape the style.  Using my round brush, the concentrator focuses on each section and dries it straight.
So far very happy with the performance of this dryer. My daughter said it really helps minimize the frizzies you get with some hair dryers. I'm hopeful it will last at least a year or two. So many hair dryers quit before you have gotten your money's worth!
This was a great dryer while it lasted.  I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  It did dry hair faster.  After 2 years the electric safety plug blew and the hairdryer is bricked.<br /><br />I just bought another cheaper Andis and see it has a 5 year warranty.  If this one had a 5 year warranty too I wish someone had said or posted something or wish I saw it if it was listed on the box if it was offered.  If you notice this ad makes no mention of warranty.<br /><br />This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  2 lbs I think.  I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  The variety in heat and speed worked out perfect for the dog and me.  My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  The weight of the dryer didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />Did I gyp myself out of warranty on this dryer?  I sure hope not because I already threw it away  :(
This blow dyer rocks. Effective, for Brand name is affordable. What I like most about it, it is super quite, yet very powerful.
this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it's supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.
My daughter loves this dryer. She enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly.
High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  Way too cute and works amazingly well.
I bought two of this because my sisters, enrolled in a beauty salon school, and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!
Conair YB075W Pro Yellowbird is really most excellent. This hair dryer is sturdy and well built. Definitely worth the money.
This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. Dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise.
Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.<br />Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.<br />Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.<br />(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).<br />Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty.
The blow dryer I had since high school finally died so I bought a new one. There's nothing special about this hair dryer, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it. Nice, powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air, hotter air - and high and low power. It works quickly on my fine hair and on my daughter's thicker hair.
It made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great. Just what I was looking for!
I have bought it for my wife, she loved it. She does not has to go work with wet hair anymore :D. I recommend it.
Love this dryer, I have had it for a long time now. works like new.
It is a hair dryer - what can I say.  It is what I wanted for the price.  I am happy with it.
the review was great. High Power!!!! Great Heat. Would reccomend this product to all..Perfect Wall mount Hair Dryer.. Quiet and easy to install.
i love this hairdryer, im no professional but it does the job and its affordable. I would recommend it to anyone.
This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.
This hair dryer is worth the price.  It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more so I don't have the fly away look.  My hairdresser recommended this hair dryer.
Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine.
Will always buy T3 Hairdryers from now on... best investment. This hairdryer is amazing... and now cheaper since it's not the most current version. I can't imagine a better hairdryer. Dries my hair super fast, and the dryer itself is super light!
I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product.  The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.
This hairdryer is the lightest and quietest I've ever used.  In fact, my husband now wants one of his own!
We picked a wall mount because she was always leaving her hair dryer plugged in, right next to the sink (that's a terrible accident just waiting to happen).  After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).  It comes with a wall template with a leveling line which makes the job go especially quickly.
This hair dryer is amazing.  Just like the one they use in my salon, and it costs so much less!  This is my second one as I loved my first one so much, when it died I bought the same thing!
I bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it. Well, I love mine too! This dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage. It also reduces frizz really well, especially when used with a round brush. They sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where I get my hair cut... at three times the price!!! I would highly recommend! This is a great deal.
This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It's just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn't damage her hair.
This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat is good, and the item is solid.
Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used..
Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry.
Light, compact and dries my hair really fast. That's exactly what I needed for day to day use and for travel.
I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy.
This was a gift for my sister, and it was a great buy for the price. A very well made hair dryer.
Love it.  It really works really well and is compact and light..It heats ups fast and gets the job done.Thanks
This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  As I am disabled, I need my rest & I need something to hold my dryer.  This works so well, I got one for my mother, too.
This is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist, and i got it for her. She loves it, and apparently it is amazing. I am bald now, so I have no need for such things, but it's nice to know I bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have.
Our old Conair started making noises about a month ago so we bought this thinking we would need it some morning.  The old one is still running, with a little noise, but it is the earlier version of this one and we have been happy with it.
I already have one of thise, but because I travel a lot, I have one at home and one for my travel trailer. Lots of heat & power in a small little dryer.
Man, let me tell ya, this thing really blows; and I mean that in a good way.<br />Buy one, it will blow you away..lol
Really love it. Have been using it for two months and it works great. The price is awesome, $7.79 with free shipping using Prime. Light weight, quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair. Can't find any problem with it. Highly recommend.
i like it  ,work very good,i will recommend it yo my friends,I'm sure they will love it like me+  good price.
This is a great product. It is really simple to hang, works well, and keeps the countertops clutter-free. We have been so happy with it, we've purchased the Sunbeam one each time... years in-between - it lasts well.
product of very good quality, impeccable wine .. recommend the truth .. I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..
I read several good reviews on this product and purchased it immediately.<br />It works great. My wife is very satisfied with this hair dryer.<br />I am considering buying a second one for my daughter.
I have thick hair and it is really hard to get my hair dries in under 30 min but this hair dryer does it everytime. love the fact that the handle folds to save space and as its been dropped  a few times i know it is well put together and sturdy i would recommend tis product.
Fast, doesn't burn, doesn't weaken over time. Love it! My grandmother is a professional hair dresser and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality.
Extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time, leaving it with a wonderful shine.  Also much quieter than my previous blowdryer, which is an added bonus.
I received this as a gift and love it!  I have naturally curly hair and live in an area of high humidity.  This dryer dries my hair and leaves it smooth rather than fly away.
Dryer is tiny and comes with a travel bag including 2 attachments; the handle does not fold. It's a real nice product overall.
it was awesome!! i love the blow dry its amazing!! very happy with it!!! yayyyyyyyyyy my hair is ffaaaabbbuulloooouusss!! im like a professional hairdresser with this tool!!
I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!
My wife had one of these for years and it finaly quit<br />Bought this one and She loves it. She loves it I Love it
got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped. she loves this one. and when it is on hot, it is hot
Saw one in Vegas hotel, had to have one.  Retractable cord is awesome if you're one to store dryer after each use.
My sister in law is hairdresser and bought me one for my 35th bday. After 10 years of using it every day it finally quit. I have very long and thick hair and this is the best hair dryer since it dries my hair quickly. I went online to Amazon to buy a new one and am thrilled. Would never go back to cheap dryer that hardly works again. You have to go Turbo!! You'll be very happy you did.
THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!  MY NIECE ASKED FOR ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AFTER USING MINE.  THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER BLOW DRYER OUT THERE, AND I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!
High heat setting is practically automatic (don't have to wait for it to heat up).  And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  This unit is even better than the ones we've used at hotels.  Highly recommend.
My daughter had used this dryer in a hotel while traveling for work & she loved it.  It was at the top of her Christmas wish list, so it was one of the most appreciated gifts she received.  She assures me it is the best dryer she has ever used.
I bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn't have to use up space.  I just bought a third one.  I've used it myself while staying at the beach cottage and it's great!!
On my second try here.  Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  If this one doesn't last longer, there won't be a third.
Great, convenient product. My husband had one and it lasted for years. He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.
I bought this dryer after using my mom's similar dryer and reading the reviews for this one. I totally love it. I have very thick long hair and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer. This one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes. It is also very light. I wish it was a tax quieter but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.
I bought one for myself.  My mom used it and was amazed.  So I got her one also.  It really makes a difference.  I dye my hair a lot, and this dryer doesn't make my hair look like hay. Edit...looks like it barely lasted 3 years. Seems short to me...I've had dryers last a lot longer.
For the money you can't beat it. Plus it comes with attachments!! I would definitely buy this if you are looking for a new blow dryer and not interested in spending too much money.
My daughter confiscated my older travel hair dryer so I decided to replace it with this one.  Maybe I should thank her because this dryer is FAR superior to my other one.  Even though it's only 1600W, it puts out a lot of air and my hair dries in no time.  I love the fact that it's a lower wattage as many older hotels throughout Europe can't handle anything higher.  How do I know?  I purchased an 1800W dual voltage one time and managed to blow out half the circuits in an old hotel in Venice.
I used one similiar to this in a hotel and loved it. So I ordered me one. This is a great product and i would reccomend this product !!!!! A+ A+ A+.
This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  The best part is the dual voltage feature--it works wherever you travel.
This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting. I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.
This is a nice dryer for the price.  Seems a bit heavy, but it works for me.  Dries my thick hair thoroughly.
Have had this for a little over a year now.  It is extremely lightweight and feels very good quality.  Plenty of different settings and all of them work well.  Good airflow and it is plenty hot or cool enough.
This hairdryer was a really good buy, and my daughter really loved having her own without having to borrow mom's hairdryer every day! It is a nice hairdryer.
Christmas Present for my wife.<br />I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned.
I mention that comes with both attachments in the subject because I was confused when I first bought it I thought it came just with the concentrator not with the diffusor but what was my surprise when I opened the box it came with both which are wonderful! I have curly hair and it worked perfectly on me
The product Worked well<br />I Would recommend<br />I Would buy again<br />Arrived on time as stated online<br />Very Cost effective
You can't get excited over a hair dryer. It works , it dries and thats all it has to do.
I got this hair dryer for Christmas, and I love it! The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly. The only &#34;iffy&#34; thing about it is it doesn't seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair.
I love love love this hair dryer. I have had it for quite a while, and it has been amazing. Great for blowing my hair straight, never burns, and dries very quickly.
I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine.  I love it.  It drys my hair very quickly and without frizz!
product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  This is definitely a no-frills, standard, and simple dryer.  If you're looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!
I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty.
Works well and I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.  Stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool.
Great product! I bought one for a gift and one for myself! Easy to use, doesn't get to hot, and lightweight!
I bought this hair dryer a few months ago to replace my old one (a different brand). This new hair dryer is as powerful as my last one (which I loved), but much quieter and my hair does not feel frizzy afterwards. My only complaint is that the handle is peeling a little at the bottom.
Great product at a great price. Provides just the right temperature, and dries very well. Have had no issues with it since purchase. Highly recommended.
This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever used.  It is very quiet and light.  Since it's an Ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny.  It's a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it's so lightweight.  I would highly recommened it..
I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair.
I am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but I feel like the power and force just isn't there. This Conair I have been very happy with.It is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair. If this ever dies, I will buy this same dryer again.
Have used it for over two months now and love it.  Easy to install and the cord stays neat on the hook.  Powerful enough to dry my short and in less than 3 minutes. My main reason for purchasing this was to find something I could hang-on the wall for easy access to use daily and to have it stored nicely in our main bathroom when not in use.
It's a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won't likely come back and review it in a few years.
i love this blow dryer. it's so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.
After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  Thank you Andis!
excellent job very satisfied. not too much more to say no problems worked out okie dokie smoky a okay .
I have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls! I love it! I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don't like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow). I would purchase this again, but another 18 inches of cord would be nice.
All I can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it. I purchased the very same one around 5 years ago. Well, it finally died, but since it was so good, I purchased another one for my wife. She says that it works faster than others she had before, that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time. She highly recommend it!
Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry
My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.  Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....<br />If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on.
I have been using the Andis Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer for years.  My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago so I replaced it with their newest model (1875W) at that time. Seeing I have had good performance with this dryer I decided to buy a back-up.
I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. The one that is used by 3 people daily finally went. Bought again because its convenient and has decent power. Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.
This hair dryer was recommended to me by a hair stylist at the salon I use. It works beautifully. A little heavier than my former Conair (which lasted 10 years). My diffuser fits on it. Has a cleanable compartment for lint.
My sister-in-law asked for this hairdryer for Christmas. Very handy for all the travel she does. She is very happy with it.
This hair dryer is small and easy to handle, but the best thing is the air flow. Many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description, but this one truly has turbo air flow. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining.
I Love it!!!! I use it everyday. One of the best blow dryers I have purchased. My hairstyles uses it on her clients.
Bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it's been great. Lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair. Get's the job done.
This hair dryer works great. It has lots of power and dries super fast. A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.
I haven't had a dryer with attachments since high school, but this thing is a life saver! I don't have to straighten my hair when I use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast. So much of my time has been saved since I got this wonderful gadget.
Great product exactly how it is described. You can't beat a Revlon blow dryer. It's also very affordable and compact.
Drys quickly, not overly noisy, switches are conveniently placed (where they're not accidentally moved on/off)  The air filter can be removed for cleaning.  I use all three temperature settings, both fan speeds, and the cool-shot button.
I have had the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for years.  Someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use.  I love this dryer, it's exactly what I've been using! I'm totally satisfied with the purchase....thanks for the quick delivery!
I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer.  Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.
THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED. IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND ITS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING
Bueno llego en perfecto estado y funciona muy bien ,es de buena potencia y el indicado  para relizar la el secado
Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product. My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler! Thanks!
Took years for me to buy a new hairdryer and I will never wait again to do so.  This hairdryer has power, works great, on the quieter side of blow dryers and really does the job!
Nice product with a lot of power.  I love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage.  Great buy.
This was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months; couldn't seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow.  This one is perfect.
Great Product for the price. Very light  and powerful. You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer. You won't be disappointed!
I've never had a ceramic hair dryer before and I'm amazed at the quality and functionality of this one.  It provides a consistent heat and air flow.  It is heavier than other dryers I've owned and I was told that it is due to the ceramic.  This dryer is also much quieter than others I've used.  The benefits far outweigh a few ounces of extra weight.
One of these is in the employee bathroom at work and I'd used it and decided I wanted one at home.  I love that it's mounted on the wall and out of the way.  Works well for what I need.
I bought two dryers this is very good!! Small, compact, easy to carry on any trip! The design is beautiful and best of all: it accepts two voltages! Excellent!
This hair dryer is awesome, The price is great and it has serious power on the top settings, you have to be careful not to burn your face, i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings. Looks good and feels nice in your hands, not to heavy. My girlfriend loves it
We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much. It was a gift but we are both enjoying it.
worked just like it is supposed to really like the dryer got the job done in half the time of my old blower. Will recommend this to anyone.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using it to dry her hair ever since.  She really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well.
Works great , does what it is supposed to do which is dry hair ..  yes the outer finish starts to peal a little bit around the handle but no big deal .. its a blow dryer not a pair of shoes.  The cost was great too!
This blow dryer is pretty impressive! I've had it for a few months now and am still happy with it. It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth. It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer! Definitely recommend!
Very strong heat and durable product. I use it every day with clients and It works great! Looks good too!
Shipped and arrived within estimated time.  My husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy.  I do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright.  I do partially close the door to our Master bath because of the light, since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom.  No complaints about using the hair dryer.  It is certainly quieter than our other one.  Would definitely purchase another.
This blow dryer is lightweight and powerful.  I have thick Keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully.  It gets very hot - which I need - and the airflow is strong.  There is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave.  I would definitely recommend this product.
A great product for a great price! I am glad I bought it. It is more than I expected. .
Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras
Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  It was just what she wanted.  It had everything that she wanted and more.
I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings & cold shot. Great for a small apartment. I've been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far. Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition. Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it's hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands.
TOTALLY RECOMENDED!! HAIR DRIES VERY FAST, I JUST GOT MINE AND IM PLEASED USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE I GOT IT
This hair dryer is attractive and a good hair dryer.  My hair can sometimes be frizzy, but with this dryer, I can get it nice and smooth.  I dry it all the way and then use the cold blast for smooth hair.
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas.. she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet.
This did a great job.  What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  I highly recommend!
Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day.  Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted.  Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.
This s the best blow dryer that I have ever used!!! Dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. Also very nice long cord which makes it easy to use.
This hair dryer has Lots of power.  I liked it a lot. I would recommend it. End. Finished. Done. Bye
Just what I wanted. Light weight and the switches to turn it off and on and the intensity are easy for me to use. I have MS and have a hard time with switches.
This drys my hair in five minutes and I have a ton of fine hair. Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right. Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  Not too big to store in our vanity drawers.
For about $12 you couldn't go wrong. Arrived quickly and blows hot air....what more could one want? So much better than e-bay!
The hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle.  It also dries faster than the average hair dryer.  Great buy!
I love it.  It's very compact and lives up to all of the product descriptions.  I would buy it again.
Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &#34;cold shot&#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I've been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it's the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn't find 'the one.' I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It's the best hairdryer I've ever used and I can get to work on time now!
Put this in our bathroom at our Oceanfront rental condo, and it works great.  Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.
Pretty good for people trying to keep their hair natural without adding chemicals. Very quick and has different settings to get hair dried well.
it does eactly what it says it would do! I get so many compliments on my  long hair and it takes 10 minutes!!!!
I read the reviews for the many different Andis hair dryers and finally decided on this one. It is great. Dries my hair quickly without causing it to be fly-away and frizzy. Great purchase!
This is an amazing hair dryer for this money. Nice design, comfortable handle. It has exceeded my expectations. Love it!
If you have short hair, it works well; not sure how it would work with long hair.  Easy to pack for travel
Product performs as expected. All plastic housing beats the partial rubberized housing of my old Revlon dryer. The rubber on the old housing becomes extremely tacky.
This is the second one I bought.  My daughter took the first one because she liked it so much.  I hope to get a lot of use from it.
Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer
Found this hair dryer while on business while staying at one of the Marriots.  I could not believe how fast it dried my hair, with very low heat and lots of air, not to mention how shiny it was.  So I decided to order my very own. My hair has never been easier to dry and style.....and best of all my precious dog gets his fur blown out by this hair dryer as well and his fur is dry at super speed.  What a great product and great price.  Last year i purchased one of these fancy dryers and all of a sudden it stopped blowing out hot air, what a waste....but perfect timing for this little baby.  I am hooked on this one.
This dryer is perfect for the intended purpose which is an efficient, small package at a very resonable price. The air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches. The folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.
Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage. I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice.
LOVE THE COOL BUTTON, WHICH HOLDS THE STYLE IN PLACE AFTER THE BRUSH IS REMOVED. MY HAIR IS STYLED MUCH BETTER DUE TO SETTINGS.....
I really like this hair dryer.  Maybe it's because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing, but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly.  And its not huge.  It's a normal size in my opinion, smaller than many in the market.  Could not ask for more in a hair dryer.
Great dryer with good fan speeds.  Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  The cool down button lets you customize your heat. Folds up for easy packing. We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.
I didn't realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived. It dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn't quiet it's a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed. It is a bit heavy, but I like that...makes it feel sturdy and well made. The finish is nice too...kind of velvety. I definitely recommend this dryer!
Wife uses it daily....says it is much quieter and lighter than previous versions, and does a great job and it easy to use...would recommend buying this item!!!
Don't hesitate, it works perfectly. Very fast.  .  .  .  .  .  .. .. . . . . . .
Dries my hair really fast!  Love the product and would highly recommend.  My daughter loved it also.  Product received on time.
excelente muy buena calidad es preciosa a mi hija le gusto mucho y soy de venezuela y todo fue rapido
I have one in my guest bathroom and my visitors can use it. You dont have to looking one in the lower of the lavatory.
It blows... it blows hot air... its uses that hot air to dry your hair. I dont have much hair, but what I do have gets dried. Seriously I dont know what else to say. If i was a woman with a ton of hair then I'd say invest in a better hair dryer. This one seems &#34;sufficient&#34; but thats it.
This is my second of the same model.  Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.
Dries hair really fast as it has good volume of air and the air temperature is just right. Only problem is that it works for 110 V AC (US domestic voltage) only.
YO COMPRE ESTO PARA MI HIJA Y LE ENCANTO LE SALVA MUCHO TIEMPO Y DINERO CADA VES QUE ELLA QUIERE HACERCE EL PELO
I replaced my old one with this dryer. My daughter has one like it and I love the amount of air produced. I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer.
It 's a nice dryer.  It works well.  I don't really use any of the special features, although it has the 3 heat settings and 1 cooling setting.  I just dry my hair.
It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast.  It is a gentle air for fine hair.
my wife loves it and the night light is very nice.  she uses it every day and finds it really works good
It works fast, quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers. I love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time.
I really love this hair dryer. My hair always looks nice and smooth and silky after using it and it dries my thick hair really fast.
My hair has come out fantastic every time with this. The attachments are great. The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...but it works. Love it and highly recommend.
I had the same hair dryer for about six years, then it gave up.  I really didn't want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  So I ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same!  Yeah!  I was able to change it out myself!
I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer.
Everytime i take it of by bag at the gym, girls start laughing, but when they see me using it and the results, they ask me where i got it...I very proud of my purchase! :D
Such a great tool! It makes hair drying much faster, and my hair never stays curly. It drys almost all straight.
If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair.
Really nice  Hair dryer. Is for a gift and I'm sure she will love it. I like the way the handle folds.
ship very fast,stuff is good!~I like it!~good styff ,I love it ,very nice good !~good good good !~very good !
Had a good experience with this order, it took about 7 business days to arrive.  And have been using this product for years.
Great hair dryer . Wife loves the retractable cord and compact size. After using the hair dryer for about a year, the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off.  The warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways, it costs as much as buying a new one.
For the price, this is a pretty nice dryer. I almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless, but I tested it just to see, and it's not quite hot enough to give me the oomph I need to dry my hair. So there's that. The cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power, and I don't use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker, but considering how much I paid for it, this does its job and it does it pretty well.
Shipped fast. This dryer dries my thick long hair quite a bit qucker than the dryer it replaced. I also really like that the cord is extra long.  I don't plan to use the attachmens so I cannot comment on those.
I like this drying in many ways. It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus! I hope it lasts a long time.
Easy to use, very handy, always at your disposal.  It isn't a powerful dryer, but it works great on mens hair.  The wall mount is simple to install, and it's shock protected.  Great value
Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  A must have, space saver and reasonable price.
My wife loves this hair dryer. It produces very warm air with tremendous air flow. I will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time I originally ordered it.
I don't need any special hair tools that cost $100. I have thick, wavy hair and this works just fine, especially with the diffuser attachment. I love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up - it makes storing it wonderfully easy. I would recommend this to anyone.
I love this little blow dryer.  I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes.
Excelent product and quick delivery!! If you want a professional hair dryer, this is used by stylists here. Thank  you from Dominican Republic! Excelente producto y entrega r&aacute;pida! Si desea un secador de pelo profesional, este es el que utilizan las estilistas aqu&iacute;. Gracias desde Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana!
It is easy to use. My sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color. I would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years, it'll be three times as puffy and frizzy after I'm done with it. After using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it. Thanks to my sis and ofourse Andis hair dryer I love and an finally manage my hair, most importantly I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning. I guess its great quality for its price. I would recommend it. Actually I did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines.
I had this model blow dryer for over 7 years until I dropped it and broke the fan. This blow dryer took many years of abuse and worked like a champ. I bought the same model to replace the one I had.
The best I have ever used.  I used it ata friend's house while away for the weekend and knew I had to buy one.  My daughters love it too.
My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn't find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!
Very good product. Lightweight and compact, but powerful. Came quickly and was well packaged.Easy to use and place out of sight.
This blowdryer is amazing. My sylist uses it in my hair and I had to buy it for my home. It works for me and my daughter with ease. A must buy.
After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how.<br /><br />Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.
I love this blow dryer. Its ionic which is the best type of blow dryer for your hair and it really does make hair smoother and softer. It very stylish looking and easy to hold. It works great every time I use it and only takes about 40 minutes to dry my hair. The heat flow is very strong and I also like the cool shot as well. It very chilly. lol
Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  I use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair.  Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord.
This Hair Dryer is PERFECT!! Love it!!! Small but, Powerful! I have very thick hair & it dryes it fast. Exactly what I was looking for.
I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described
drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy.
I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can't believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn't spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don't hesitate to buy this - you won't regret it.
my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item. she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones
I love everything about this hair dryer, so I am glad I ordered it.  It is lightweight and does a great job.
I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It's not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made. I will have to see how long it lasts.
No complaints. I have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly. The settings are great. The cord is wonderful. The price is awesome.
Conair makes great hair dryers, and this in no exception. Relatively quiet, and generates sufficient heat to satisfy most customers.
This hair dryer make and model is a replacement  of a product that I have been using for several years.  This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops.
I like it... it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel ... My hair gets dry very quick I was surprise with the power of this dryer I thought it might be too low, but not.  yes buy it  is a good product and cheap ...one year warranty ..
Fantastic dryer night light is great for kids and two speed is awsome!! Will buy another one of these next time!!
Great price, lightweight, long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier, not as noisy as my last hair dryer, and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers. I am able to switch from warm to hot and high, off, low without having to look at the dryer.  I really do love this hair dryer!!
I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  I had it for many years before it gave out.  I have thick, curly hair and this gets it dry in no time.  Its light weight and easy to hold.  It has 3 different heat settings and high/low setting for air flow.  Very happy with this product.
Ingenious product. Simple and convenient. I glued it to my mirror and stayed there. No more trouble holding the dryer on one hand and brushing my hair with the other one! worth every penny
This is an awesome hair dryer - I never really thought there was much difference between the various kinds until now! My hair, which is thick, drys super quick and this dryer eliminates all the frizz - amazing :)
Gives great volume with exceptional heat control!  Would recommend to anyone looking to enhance body and volume with their hair.
Love this hair dryer!  Purchased this model after seeing the Good Housekeeping reviews.  Lightweight, the right amount of power to style my hair just right, nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long, flexible cord, and all at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend this product.
A hotel I stayed at had this model. Loved it so much came home from my trip and ordered it. Dries my hair quickly and small enough that it doesn't take up too much counter space in my bathroom.
I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home.  It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  These 2 features alone make it great for travel!
It's just as advertised.  Dries my hair quickly, folds up nicely and neatly. The retractable cord is great. It's a good purchase.
My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers. Other wise your hair really won't dry or curl. The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.
For years, I've used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space). The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying. Its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue. Durability is good - our's usually last at least five years with daily use by two people. The current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug/GFI than earlier models. While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.
I am thrilled with this hair dryer.  It is better than even I imagined.  Looked at several at the local beauty supply houses... all with huge price tags.  I am so happy with this one, I can't begin to explain.  My hair is not fly-away like it is with my old dryer.  It has plenty of volume and is sleek and shiny.  I can't believe it took me so long to buy such a quality dryer.  I recommend this highly!
I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn't fry it. Would recommend it.
It is very potent and haven't given me any problem so far.<br />I paid $3 and something plus shipping, so it was very cheap and I think it's a good quality product.<br />OK, it might not be the best hairdryer out there (it is not made of ceramic and has no ion-thingy to keep your hair from splitting and things like that), but it was just what I needed. I would buy it again (for that price).
This dryer is absolutely awesome. The heat settings are exactly what I needed, and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying. Really worth the price.
I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet, the retractable cord works well, and it has a cold setting as well as a cold button. It feels solid and is easy to handle.  It's everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.
I just love my new hair dryer and gets my hair nice and straight without getting to hot. It comes with two attachments and is priced right for me.
Really works well.  One if the best hair dryers I have owned.  Definitely a great deal since they are $300.00 retail
One of the best reasonably priced dryers out there. My old one made my hair frizzy and dried out, I am so pleased with my results!
I have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all.  I run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients
I had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl, this one is great! best price on net.
I ordered this because it was cheaper than Sallies sold it for. I actually have this product and it has been the best hair dryer I've ever owned, so I ordered a new one for my mom as a gift. It came in the exact packaging and I couldn't be happier. Now my mom can stop stealing my hair dryer!
I got this for a trip that I was taking and didn't want to take my bulky dryer.  This one is lightweight, has good power selectiion and temperature control settings.  I'm very happy with Conair products
After 8 years with my old hair dryer. It was time for a new one.<br />This dryer had more option than my old one.<br />And it cut my drying time in half.
Good speed and heat options. I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)
THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, I ALSO USE IT FOR STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR BECAUSE IT CAME WITH ATTACHMENTS.<br />MY HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD AND IT CAME WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY.
Great lightweight dryer. Dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you, even in a busy salon.
A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.
The off-on switch on my old Conair travel dryer broke after 5-6 years, so I purchased this one after reading reviews. It's even more compact than the old one, and I was pleased to find that it came with a 6' cord, unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn't stretch far. It dries my hair in about 3 minutes, and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing, too. The only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer. The old Conair came with one and I saved it - the new one fits perfectly.
This is the best $35 investment that I could have possibly made for my hair.  I have thick, coarse, curly-ish with a semblance of a wave hair so blow-drying it can be quite a challenge.  This hair dryer gets my hair very straight in no time.
The product works as advertised and actually dries my hair in less than half the time as my other hair dryer with much less heat!  I almost didn't believe it was possible until using this unit.  The only problem is the color of the unit is not the same as what's here or even on the box.  I was expecting red.  It's not.  It's a metallic hot pink.  Definitely something difficult for a man to pull off unless you're married and can claim it belongs to your wife.
I purchased this hair dryer because I used one in a hotel I was staying at and liked it.  I also took into consideration that I have limited space in which to hang it and it was perfect.
This was exactly as advertised; I especially liked the dimensions given. Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.
Perfect size for travel. It works better than any hotel wall mounted blower I've tried---It is quite powerful for its size---not like a regular size blower of course. Over all I am very pleased
I'm a hairstylist and this was recommended by a couple of coworkers. It recently arrived, but I've used it on a number of clients already and it's great. Strong airflow, high heat, lightweight, cool shot button, and works very well with my diffuser attachment also.  Makes my job much easier!
It's powerful and with high efficiency. Just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time (at least more than 6 months.)  :D<br />By the way, delivery is also fast.
Usually I buy Conair hair dryers but chose the Andis and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  I have not used the attachments because I have short, straight, thick hair that I blow dry and it just falls into place requiring little brushing.  I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends.
Delivered on time. This is the only dryer my wife likes. She uses it everyday.
This blow dryer is great.  It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  Love it.
I bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations. When folded up, this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn't bulky at all. This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried. The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.
Love this hairdryer ..... its one of the best around ...... drying time is so much less and it doesn't fry your hair as many others have.<br />I would buy it again.
Shipped quickly and works wonderfully. Nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time. You will not be sorry!
This little beauty has great heat and blowing capacity.  I love it and use it at home and when traveling.  I like the small size and light weight.  It's amazing that they packed 1600 Watts into this tiny little blower.  You'll love the power it has. I have since bought two for others as gifts.
I had another T3 that died after years of use. I received my new drier expeditiously and don't want to be without it. Great service and great product.
Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer.  Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I've had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I'd recommend.
If you are looking for a great dryer for both home and travel...This is it! I am more than satisfied with this product. In fact, I will be ordering another one because I do not want to be without it. The shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well.
I can not say enough good things about this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry. Now I can actually leave for work on time. My previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast. No reason to ever spend more money again. I am a very satified customer. Without a doubt, I will be a repeat customer next time I need a new hair dryer.
Nice size for storage. Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry. It would be nice to have a hanger loop.
Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks
love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel! perfect size, weight and great air quality. drys hair quickly.
Like others that have reviewed, I had used this hair dryer at the Cosmpolitan Hotel in Vegas.<br />Took a photo with my phone so I could order one when I got home.<br />I have lots of hair and it does a great job and has the benefit<br />of folding and retractable cord.
I love the Infinity Conair hairdryer.  I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn't get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  The Cord Reel works great.
I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!
I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product! Blow dryer is awesome and works very well
brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn't realised that it was American plug so I've purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)
I replaced this unit after 15 years with the same model.  Works great, just need to clean fan area occassionally.
I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!
I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment.
We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it's just a superior design.<br /><br />Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount. Excellent performance in drying hair.<br /><br />I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find.
I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.<br /><br />All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.
I saw this in a hotel I was staying in and came home and ordered! Takes a mess off the counter and works like a pro. Turns my bathroom into that hotel feel every morning!
I can not tell you how amazing this blow dryer is!  A great price too!  A must have for every woman!
Straight forward, strong hot heat. I'm a guy and this thing is the simple hot strong wind I wanted. Simple High and Low setting. That's all.
My husband has been using a hair dryer with broken teeth off the comb for what seems like forever.  When he mentioned it, I immediately went to Amazon, found just the right hair dryer and it works perfectly.  It has just the right heat and accessories for both of us.  I would suggest to others to buy this  one.
Very light weight, and is not too hot on hair, gets the job done! Very happy with this hair dryer!
This hair dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever purchased. It is light, easy to handle, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Will dry hair very quickly, eliminating flyaways and frizz. Great tool for the price.
This little hairdryer is very light, easy to use, with 2 attachments. The controls are easy to use, and there's a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air. I'm very happy with the purchase.
I have previously owed one of these and I really like the convenience of the wall mount. heat and air are great
I had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs. I have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months & solano which has completely destroyed my hair....only because I couldn't remember the name of my old dryer. It was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo. It is by far the best blow dryer I have ever had!!
This is a good basic dryer.  I don't use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold.  I don't think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product's quality, but it's still a fine product.
My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!
This is a great hair dryer.  Easy to use and store.  I don't like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  We had stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington DC and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.
This hairdryer works and is easily portable.<br />It been taken to many places since I bought it<br />and my wife - who is fussy about stuff like this -<br />adores it!
When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.
This hair dryer is great. I especially love the cord keeper feature. Very good product. I would recommend this product to anyone.
It's extremely hot, so it just takes 15-20 minutes for me blow dry my wet hair as if I have ironed it :)
This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.
I had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer. This one is amazing. It gets my hair dry a lot quicker, does not overheat, and has great adjustable speeds and heating. However, I will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold. I will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because I don't know where else to comfortably hold it.
I recently stayed in a high-end hotel, and this is the hairdryer that was in my room.  After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost.  When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn't too loud.  It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer.
I am always traveling and needed something light weight and small. After reading other reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I love it. It's very light and small. It also comes with a travel size bag. It doesn't tangle your hair. Very good dryer for those who's always on the go or even if you're not and you want something light and small!!!
This thing takes a damp haired, angry wife, into a glowing beauty with gorgeous hair. It also has a suctioning action that's not advertised, it sucks the angry out of nearby females and it pacifies them in a way I've never seen before.
I ordered thursday night I received Friday night. comparing its price, I really suprised from its quality. It is pleasant to touch its surface and it works very well. I am really oversatisfied. touch wood!! I hope I wont have a trouble in coming days.
My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh'll use in place of her old one when we get home.
Fast shipping. Nice weight, high quality product. Great choices of speeds, heat and cooling levels. Dries hair quickly and effortlessly. Highly recommended.
This hair dryer is great because of a few key features: 1- the retractable cord. ok ok not so special. 2- it has 3 heat settings, 3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of. Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too. Not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap. And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !
Perfect for long thin hair that doesn't need to be dry in a salon. It won't burn your hair and will leave it with no friz
I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and I am so glad I did. I don't have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair. It's right there and the night light feature is great also. My hair isn't thick so the blow power isn't an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time. I'm thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a Christmas gift.
I bought this hair dryer because I liked that it came with the attachments and that it was reasonably priced. What I found was in addition to the attachments, this hair dryer is very powerful! I recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure I had it on high, then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way! What a huge difference.<br />I highly recommend this dryer. My only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place. I had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident. I still give it five stars though!
I purchased this hair dryer over two years ago (after using one at a hotel) and it's still going strong.  It's a great dryer - light weight, perfect size, enough power to dry my hair, and very reasonably priced.  I'm ordering another one as a back up, in case they quit making this model.  Love it!!!
This dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half, it works very well and I am very happy to have bought it.
I own three Andis Turbo 1600w hair dryers. Why?  It has tremendous power and dries hair quickly. The low setting is very adequate.  The Andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers.  It's excellent for hair health because the heat temp. is modified.  (severe heat damages hair).  My first Andis is 10 years old. My thanks to the engineers!  This is a very good product.  I have owned countless hair dryers.  At last, I've found the best.
I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair.
This hair dryer is amazing!  My hair is very wavy & @ time very curly,<br />This dryer let's me style my hair easily.  It makes my dryer time so much faster.<br /><br />Love it!!<br /><br />Maggie, River Vale, NJ
This is the second time I purchased the same exact item. My first one lasted at least 4 years! It works.
I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!
This is the second Andis hair dryer that I have purchased because I like it so much. When we remodeled our bathroom, this is the hairdryer that came to mind. I like the night light feature. It is very bright and GREEN! The dryer has plenty of power and has an adjustable heat setting. Can't go wrong with this product. Our first one is at least 20 years old and we are now using it in a different bathroom.
I purchased two of the hairdryers on Aug 12th, and today is Sept. 13th so they are only one month old.  I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead.
Great product, easy and fast results. love it!! Fast shipping.. I have curly hair and this product straightens my hair in about twenty-twenty five minutes.. and I am no professional.
After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn't sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I've been using this now for a few months I think, & I love it.
Our old dryer died and we decided to try this one for the ionic system. The dryer is very fast, has mutiple settings and my wife who didn't like hair dryers, because she has very fine hair, really likes this one and uses it. It does a very good job and this model seems perfect to me.
I was able to test drive this hair dryer at La bellaserra hotel in Paso Robles.  It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!
I've been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. This product is every bit as AWESOME as people have said!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I have shoulder length, curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half. Worth every single penny!!!!
My wife loves this new hair dryer.  It blows her old hair dryer away.  She has been very please.  We have not issues with the product at this time.  She uses it most days.
I bought this for my wife and she really likes it, she says it's the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life.
Only been using this for about a week now so I can't speak to the longevity of the dryer but I really love it so far.  Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I'm tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away.
So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.<br /><br />With our old high end hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as Hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.<br /><br />Then I bought her this dryer.<br /><br />Her shoulder feels better because it's so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.<br /><br />We now own two of these...they are great!  She's an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!
A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!
I am LOVING this blow dryer! My hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny!!!! I'm hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks bc I love this brand and will never buy another cheap Walmart brand!!!!!
I do not buy anithing without try it first. But this blower its really great. its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half. I love this product.
I was really surprised when I received this hair dryer because the quality of the product~ IT IS GREAT<br />The dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it.
Great product for the price. Works great and has nice settings. It came with two snap on extentions which both work nice on my hair.
I've been a stylist for 15 yrs and I can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however I do recommend getting the Twin Turbo/ionic for $30 more it's worth every penny. I couldn't be more happier and it's made in Italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it. The weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful.
I have very thick hair and go through blow dryers quite frequently. I am always upset when I have to spend so much($75+) on something I know I will have to replace.<br /><br />Well this dryer has been WONDERFUL! I have had it much longer than I have had any other blow dryer. Also I can rest easy knowing that if I do have to replace it it is well within a reasonable price.<br /><br />Thank you Conair!
La nano-cer&aacute;mica i&oacute;nica seca el cabello tecnolog&iacute;a como ninguna otra. En vez de seco, paja-como el pelo seco el Andis proporciona un secado flexible y suave que hace que el pelo se siente muy sano y natural.
While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.
I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.
I have used this product at three other facilities and it is a value for the cost. Mounts easily and works as detailed.
I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don't function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn't detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use.
I love this hair dryer!  It works so well with my thick hair.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone with thick hair.
excellent dryer! very powerful, love it so much.  Arrived earlier than expected, and works like a salon dryer.  Im so relieved because I had gotten previous dryers that were so weak and kept my hair wet.  This one dries my thick hair in less than 10 minutes
This is really a great hair dryer. I love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat.  WOuld not trade it for anything.
I'm a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow.
I used one of these at the Marriot, and I loved it so much that I had to have one!  Love the power that it has and the folding handle.
Other reviews indicate the advertising was in error as the unit did NOT include acool slection.  The one we received DID have this. The unit is extremely light and gets the job done.
I also found this dryer at a hotel. Loved how quickly it dried my very thick hair! Was even happier when I found out how inexpensive it is!
I bought this dryer after trying it at a hotel we stayed at.  Love the way it folds up and is easy to transport and store. Great product at a great price
Love this hair dryer. The different speeds are great and drys fast Got it fast in the mail love that.
I just LOVE my new Conair hair dryer! Very sturdy feeling and the buttons/controls work smoothly- much better hair dryer than my Revlon 1875 which was awkward and cheaply constructed. I have always preferred the Conair Ion Shine and am glad to have a new Conair at a pricetag of $13 ???<br />Motor does seem quieter than my other hair dryers and the 'cool shot' button is an added bonus.<br />Might just have to get another at this price. :)
a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon.  I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!
I've had this for a while now and it is still working perfectly. Dries my hair quickly and doesn't leave it as frizzy when I use it with the included extension. The different heat settings are great too; I like having a cool option instead of just a cool button.
Everyone should own this hair dryer.  Throws out a lot of heat, works very well with Afro-American hair. The comb is very strudy. Only complaint it is somewhat heavier than what I expected.
This hairdryer has all the features I want: retractable cord, powerful, folds up, cool botton and attractive.  I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I'm bying the same one again.
I've had my blo and go for a month now, after a recent accident left me severely handicapped this little item has saved my life when it comes to getting my hair dried. Can't recommend this enough whether you got one or both hands you just won't believe how much help this is.
This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  Did a great job.
This dryer works great and saves space.  I have one at our home and at our Lake House.  I love the night lite it has.  Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too.
I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  So far it meets all of her expectations and we're very satisfied.  We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.
This blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one.......just love the fact that the cord retracts!  It's not cumbersome, has two speeds and a cooling option.  Terrific value for the money.
As a cosmetologist, we all need a professional blower, shipped a lot sooner than what I expected and worked perfectly fine. Brand new product.
I would order with them again for sure. Package arrived in a timely fashion. Love the product. Professional correspondence with them.
I purchased this a while back and still works great. I definitely would recommend to buy this product, worth the money and the item shipped fast! :)
I just love it. I was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling and it's exactly what I was looking for. The heat is just perfect and it keeps the hair shiny.
This is a neat little hair dryer that has alot of power and does not take up much space. I really like it.
This product works really good and the price is reasonable. I strongly recommanded.<br />I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.
This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  This one should last me a long time.
Love this. it's light weight which is nice and easy to use. I have a lot of hair, and it dries so fast with this hair dryer! would def recommend it!
I have very thick hair that is difficult to dry. This hair dryer is powerful and dries my hair quickly and easily. I love it.
This replaced a hairdryer that's oh, about 25 years old and still working. Gotta say, it's a welcome change. Love the ionic aspect, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Powerful but quiet motor. Other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell. I can't say I've noticed, and there's never any reason to blow it in my face, so not a problem. Love the soft feel of the housing, love the little rubber bumper that doesn't allow it to slide on the countertop, love the long cord ... maybe I'll get 25 years out of this one, too!
This little hair dryer really does the trick! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option, but for me, with my long, thin and falling out hair its perfect. It doesn't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus. I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn't release and so far I am very happy with the product. It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well. I love it!
Initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with European voltage as well as US. I now use it every day. Its light and powerful. Highly recommend.
This works awesome! Great or long thick hair. I love the speed and the cooling feature actually works, others that Ive had do not really feel cooler..this works great for a finished look.
Was looking for a blow dryer that would dry my thick hair in under 45 minutes and I found it. Definitely not for thin hair.<br /><br />This is exactly what I was looking for.
I like this dryer. It works well and I like the night light as well. It works well for a small bathroom.
At present, I am using this hair dryer at home.  I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag. When I visit family and friends I like to bring my own hair dryer so I keep one packed in my suitcase.<br />This hair dryer is light and powerful.  My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage.
I have only used this dryer once, but it works very well.  My hair is fine so it doesn't take long to dry so this dryer does the job quickly.  All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others.
I love this hair dryer. It is so light weigh and powerful that I am stiling my hair a lot faster than before.
I purchased the black one via Amazon and I am very pleased with the product so far. I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!
I bought this hair dryer because it is the one my hair stylist uses in her salon. And, since it's such a strong dryer, it takes much less time to dry my hair. Also, it does a better job than any other hair dryer I have ever owned.
I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I'm throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients= fast money;)
I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  I love it!!  It's lightweight, has a retractable cord and folds.  Great for travel or storage!  I'm on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep just in case.
The ceramic dryer made drying my hair much easier than ever before. It cut my time down drastically and no more tangles at all. I love this hair dryer!
What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis.
this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers. it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny.
I love this hair dryer.  I have fine, thin, hightlighted hair and it is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  Highly recommend.
Lightweight, quieter than most, and dries my hair in half the time! All dryers are NOT the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening!
I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home.  Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can't style it properly.  Medium works great for me.  Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months.  With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died.  I immediately ordered another one.  At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain.
I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  I purchased this ceramic, ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve<br />a softer look. Itgave the results that I was looking for. It certainly works! Also a good feature it the automatic cord wind. I am very pleased. The dryer was reduced in price and<br />this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price.<br />I would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.
This is the 2nd one I've bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn't stopped working it started to smell hot and I didn't want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.
I'm happy with the Infiniti by Conair 223XR dryer and its features. Retractable cord, 1875 watts, different settings for cold/warm/hot temperature and also low/high air speed setting. I like the fact that it already comes with both a concentrator and diffuser. It doesn't take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect! I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling. The dryer has a nice design and color. I've been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it.
I bought this dryer for 3 reasons,: 1. My dryer is about to pass on 2. I have arthritis in my shoulder & wanted a lighter weight one & 3. Based on the reviews here I purchased this dryer. I wasn't planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter's a professional & I don't see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear & tear!<br />I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time & it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder & irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice & small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair & not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far & will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!
Love this hair dryer!  I used it at a hotel recently and couldn't believe the power of this little dryer.  I have long, thick hair and my hair was dry in no time! Would definately recommend!
Good power.  Easy to handle.  Settings don't get in the way of the handle.  This is the third one I've bought.
Love these dryers! Had one for 9 years, finally burned out. Just bought 2 more. So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.
This hair dryer does a very good job. It has multiple settings for heat and fan speed. Very good value.
My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel. This is exactly what we were looking for. It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.
I purchased this product after reading all the reviews, and it did not disappoint.  I love it because it dries nicely, it's not too noisy to operate plus it has a retractable cord.  I would say it's well worth the price I bought it from Amazon compared to other blow dryers!!
Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City. Works great. Very powerful & I like the retractable cord,very nice . Would recommend highly.Great price also.
I'm really enjoying the use of this product. It heats well and I'm usually dry in 30 minutes. I love how light weight it is, because I can hold it in my lap while I either work on the computer or watch TV.
I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  I was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once I started using this one, there was a noticeable difference.  It's much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  It's also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  And of course, it's always nice to have a retractable cord.  I'm very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)
Every day I used to dread blow drying my hair. It's long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn't be dry. This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max. It has totally changed my life. I have bought one more just to have on hand. You never know how long a hair dryer will last.
Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it<br />everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and<br />love the fact that the cord retracts.  I decided to go ahead and order a<br />second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck<br />it wouldn't be available then, and I really like it.
I had been looking to purchase a blow dryer for our spare bathroom and trailer when I found this one I was so happy it has exceded all my expectations. It was such a good deal. I am very pleaswed with the product and how fast it arrived.
This hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations. I am so glad I got this unit from Conair. The dryer arrived before the specified date and I use it all the time to dry my hair.
Great folding hair dryer for a great price.  I needed a hair dryer to take on the Fantasy carnival cruise.  The Glory had a hair dryer in the drawer but unfortunately the Fantasy did not.  It is going on another cruise this Fall on the same Fantasy.
This helps us from having STUFF all on the top of our bathroom countertop, since we have limited counter top in this Bathroom. We had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom, our motorhome.  Great for organization & small places.
I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it. So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn't have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!
I absolutely love this blow dryer. It works so well, and gets the job done in half the time. I highly recommend this blow dryer, I use it in the salon, and it gets my clients in and out in half the time.
Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have. Also,good for the price - great for short hair. curl too
This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn't reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  This little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well.  I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details.
After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it.
I'm a hairstylist, and Twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands, if anybody likes to get fast and quality style, this is the perfect product, it's powerful and last longer..... I loved it
It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn't use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.
Excellent product and frankly deserves attention<br />The experiences of this product I am relieved a lot<br /> And all my friends who saw him Aaajabu
Tried this blow dryer at a hotel, went to my iPhone and ordered it immediately. I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz.
I've been using this hair dryer for over a year and I still love it.  The cord reel is my favorite feature.  It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.
I love the hair dryer, fits the wall perfectly, cord is long enough & hangs on hook when not in use.<br />For the ones that do not like the night light on the base, you can push the test button which will turn the light off.  Then push the reset button to turn it back on &/or to use the dryer.
It was so hard to find a blow dryer that had a lot of airflow and this one meets the price/performance ratio. I highly recommend this.
I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently. I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it. It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle. I really like that it has 3 speeds. It also has a cool blast button, but I don't use that. It is also quite quiet for a hair dryer. One of the best features is the retractable cord. Now I don't have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet. I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn't crazy about because it was too large and quite loud. Very happy with this! I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years.
We had the previous model for over 5 years.  Worked every day till the heating element broke.  So we had to replace it.  New unit is only improved.  Uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall.  We expect great things for this replacement.
This hair dryer works great. I have long thin hair and I am quite happy with the performance of this dryer and its settings. The hot temperature is hot without being too burning, and the high blows just the right amount of air. I actually like using the hair dryer with the concentrator on it and that's something I haven't been able to say about any of the last other models I've owned. I also feel like it dries my hair without leaving it frizzy, but there is only so much I can judge on that since my hair is long, thin, and straight. Overall, very happy with the product!
I have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly..it also makes my hair a lot smoother! I would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality.
I first used this hair dryer at Courtyard Marriott. It worked so good and did wonders for my hair. I was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these. It dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look. I highly recommend this hair dryer.
I saw this dryer in Good Housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try, even though I was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer.  This one really is better!  Dries faster, and seems very gentle.  The cooling feature is great for setting curls and body.<br /><br />I ordered a second dryer for my daughter, but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed.  I knew this wasn't right.  I contacted Amazon about the defective product, return shipping was free and easy, and a replacement arrived in two days.  Thanks, Amazon!
I have been a blowdry failure all my life! Just can't seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens. When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought What, is this battery-operated?? It will take forever to dry my hair! But I have been pleasantly surprised. It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn't tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever. If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you. I do wish it had a cold shot button, but that is the only drawback.
This a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price. It is quiet and efficient. This is a very  good BUY!!!! Recommended.
powerful and very lovely to use! highly recommend! I just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly! :)
We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord.
I'm no hairdryer expert, but this fit my needs perfectly. It folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly.
I did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer. I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Pros:<br />Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm<br />Puts out more air than the VS501<br />Folds up for easy storage and travel<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Cons:<br />Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow<br />Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store<br /><br />Overall Summery:<br />The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design. The color isn't my favorite, but the fact that it meets all my criteria and I can take it with me when I travel makes up for it.
There is not much I require of a hair dryer, just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level.  I'm not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than $20.  Great buy in my opinion.
When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn't want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!
Confession time: I am not a man. I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!
Performs great,  no problems.  Light is perfect brightness.  1200 watt setting works just fine.  Great space saver.  Used in hotels and great for kids bathrooms.
This dryer is not harsh on my hair....love all the heat/speed levels! Excellent buy! No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!
I love the color! The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair! The cord retracts. There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp). Great for touch-ups, too. I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it. Great investment!
if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.<br /><br />Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment Wow - This dryer is really quiet!  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!<br /><br />I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!<br /><br />I give this dryer an  A+++++++
I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!
This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.<br />I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said First Class on it.  I've seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.<br />I can't review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the First Class Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS.
My old faithful Conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement...and a dandy one it has turned out to be.  It dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle.  No problems of any kind.  Good purchase.
This small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom...up and out of the way! Easy to mount! Highly recommend!
I have a lot of hair and have owned a lot of hairdryers in my life.  I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference. This thing is amazing.  It's works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel. I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  I ended up buying it for myself as a birthday present -- what a great decision.<br /><br />If you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer.
i have curly hair. After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one. i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever. i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes. then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly. its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.
I have very thick and long hair and after having my old dryer for years, the motor was worn out and old. This new dryer is a perfect size, less bulky than my old one, and also very quiet. I don't get ringing in my ears due to the noise. It is not very heavy and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am very happy with this product.
I am so glad I found this hair dryer. I was initially looking for one that had the folding handle, but was not successful at the time. This one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job, just as good. It's easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way, even to pack for travel.  I've had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day I got it. It's not quiet, but it's not overly noisy either - just sounds like a hair dryer.
I really like this blow dryer. It has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly. The price was just right.
Love this blowdryer. It is a bit louder than my Chi Nano and isn't as powerful but it doesn't seem to effect the drying time. Also I would love for it to have a stand but no biggie :)
This hairdryer is perfect. No more hunting for the hairdryer, it's right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom. I've only had it for a month but so far I am very pleased.
good travel dryer. small, light and worked well for our three week trip to Italy. only needed the outlet adapter. did not need a heavy converter. still using for travel.
What a huge difference this dryer has made on my hair with only using it one time!! My hair has no more frizz!! I'm so happy :-)
The drier is GREAT. I don't usually review items but this drier is the best one I've ever used. For the price ($23.66), it far exceeded my expectations. Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It's not heavy, the 'ion' technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don't even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one.
The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.<br />Don't mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..<br /><br />It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.
This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it's not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it's not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors.
Very nice hair blowers.  Easy to attach to bathroom wall.  Makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a place to store when you are done.
I bought this T3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it.  I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  I contacted Best Buy Beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer.  Great customer service!  Thank you Jennifer Cavanagh
after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years, it finally died on me. i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it. it was suppose to arrive on a friday and i recieved it on monday :)) that was a plus, after usuing it I LOVED IT, it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget. i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz !! love this product !
I've always wanted a compact hair dryer that I could have on the wall.  This is one is the perfect one since I don't have a big storage area.  It makes my life much more organized and I just love it.  It works perfect!~
I first bought this because the gym I went to had this hair dryer and I always liked how it dried my hair.  I also figured people use the hair dryers all day long at the gym so they must last.  So when I was in the market for a new hair dryer and decided to buy the same one.  Ive used this everyday for the past 2.5 years and still works great.  The lint catcher is easy to clean out and has good excellent heat and drying power.  When this one someday wears out I will be buying the exact same one again.
Like the Oster hair dryer a lot.  It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  Great choice!
I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can't think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice.
I bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly! She loves the product. You would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price!
perfect size, power, and light in weight.. best of all great price.. I couldnt ask for more<br />I use it eveyday @1st I though the power was not enough.. But I was wrong this little<br />dryer packs a punch...! its so I bought another one to share with friend (as a gift) lol<br />and the price.. you cant even find 1 this low
We first encountered this dryer in a hotel room.  My wife used it and immediately fell in love with it.  Small, but it packs a punch. Plenty heat and plenty air volume.  She simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick.  I checked with Amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel.  She loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now.  We highly recommend this item.
I read a lot of negative reviews on this dryer. I love it! It's lighter  weight than the older model and low noise. Drys my hair fast without being so hot that it burns my hair!!
it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big. the power of it is really nice
My daughter purchased this and because she wanted something cheap and in-expensive but with good quality. This was perfect. It came with the Concentrator. The one negative thing I have to say is that my daughter would've liked to have something like the Universal Finger Diffuser. Other then that it has really nice settings Low Med and High with a cooler button and it isn't very heavy.
I was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend, who was also recommended it by a friend. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth. I had my old dryer for over 4 years, and the change in my hair's texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge. I would recommend this to anyone, and I really like the look and style of it.
This Hair Dryer is very convenient. Small and it has a pretty good power.  The item arrived in perfect conditions.
I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.<br /><br />So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn't bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren't a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.<br /><br />Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.<br />I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)
i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look. The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it...
Excellent product. It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  I recommend the product highly.
This is the best blow dryer I have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair. I have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull. But this blower leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free.
I have thick hair that is cut into a bob. This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way. It does have a nice night light that is bright, but I count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren't ready for a regular light.
This hair dryer is the one I'm keeping after returning two others to Walmart.  It has three heat settings, and the hot is actually hot.  It's lighter than other dryers too.  It's my favorite because it's significantly quieter than the others I tried.
I REALLY LIKE THIS DRYER. THE FACT THAT IT HAS A RETRACTABLE CORD IS A REAL PLUS. THE HEAT AND SPEED SETTINGS ARE ALSO GREAT.
Having fine hair I find the 1875 watt hair dryers a little too forceful to be able to style my hair while drying it so I was looking for a 1600 watt hoping that it would make a difference and it did. They are hard to find so I was really happy to find this one. It's nice lightweight and even comes with some styling tools.I personally couldn't be happier!
Unlike some hairdryer's that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums...This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  Lightweight and folds up when you need to travel.  Great design on the retractable cord..which once you have this you won't be able to ever buy one without this feature.
This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.
This is the first electric equipment I bought from Amazon, and it is ALL beyond my expectation. I highly recommend it. If you want to buy a non-professional hair blower with professional effect, you should try this. The only thing not perfect is that the plug is a little hard to fit, but it's okay.
This hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use.  Many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor.  Fan was found as the dryer provided in a Hampton Inn.
excellent for thick long hair , it just take me 15 min to dryhair , my hair now shiny and looks more stylist
Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.<br /><br />Cons: It's not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It's also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.<br /><br />Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong.
WOrks fantastic and came with a diffuser and another nozzle for straigtening! Very inexpensive and works great!  I bought one for myself and one for my mother.
My wife wanted this to replace an old broken one.  It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  She said she likes it.
I'm just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following:<br />Good airflow<br />Quiet<br />Drys the hair quickly<br />This hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right.
I have very long hair so it use to take me about 20 min to dry .  I read the reviews so I thought I would take a chance What a differece With this hair dryer it only took 5 min I could not believe it def not sending this one back
It's a great little hair dryer. Small footprint on wall & dries hair efficiently. What more could you ask for.
This unit is quieter than others I have, and dries my hair faster--seems to have good power. I also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly.
Compact, sleek and the best part is - the dual voltage that makes this the best travel companion I could ask for.  Did I mention that it works so well, that it takes me half the time it used to with my old dryer. A must buy! I'm planning to buy a couple more as gifts!
I have received this product today and used it. This blower makes my hair more manageable, and dried it faster too. I have a thick hair, and although my old blower is not really old (3-4 years old) but it makes my hair  frizzy after I use it. After reading the reviews, I said that I will give it a try, and I am happy that I did. I like this product and I recommended it.   p.s. I also read in some of the reviews that they died after several months so for now I am giving it 5 stars and I will update my review if it breaks since I just used it once.
I purchased this dryer 6 months ago. I have very long and thick hair - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair. I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord. The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches. Not a big deal in my opinion.
It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth. And you can't beat the price either. I'm never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production.
high watts, nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher, but still worth the price.  i still use it to this day, the cheery brightens the day too.
Love it, love it.  I really like how this dryer works on my hair.  It does not<br />leave it dry or fly away, but nice, shiny and lively.
i love this hair dryer, decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair.  this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time.  it looks good and very easy to use.  the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers. my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair. but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom, it will be fine.  if you want a good hair dryer for a great price, this is it.
My wife has been wanting one of these after our first Motel several years. Now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told.
I love my T3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer.  I had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it... so I started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the T3.  I can't believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now.  Truly frizz free!  It is very light weight and easy to use.  I actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new T3, and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it,lol.  It really made me value my new dryer.  My hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways I used to use to style.
My daughter recommended that I buy this dryer.  I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  I also bought it for my daughter-in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time. Her hair is straight and she loves this product.
I've only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!
The product was exactly what we expected; excellent.  The arrangement for receiving the product was much more difficult as amazon.com would not ship this product, only available in the US, to Canada.
I have long, mid-back length, color treated hair.  I take really good care of it and only use salon products, use heat protectant etc.  I get my hair trimmed regularly, but my ends just felt really dry and my hair was so unmanageable.  My old blowdryer was a Bedhead one and it made my hair so hot I couldn't even touch it.  I decided to invest in the Chi Rocket after reading the great reviews. I honestly can't believe what a huge difference it's made in my hair.  It's amazingly soft and smooth.  I really don't even need to do anything else to it after blowdrying, but I use a big curling iron and it looks fantastic!  I wish I would have bought this years ago!  I will never go back to a cheap blowdryer again!
This stuff worked miracles on my callused feet and my cuticles. Along with being antimicrobial you can't miss with this product. Very little goes along way so it will last you.
I love tsi-la. Their scents are great and all natural without making you smell like an incense shop. I've tried other natural scents that are overpowering or as my non-crunchy sister would say it smells ethnic in here when I walk into a room. Moving on, all the tsi-la scents I've tried are great. I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent! If you are concerned that perfume has toxic, hormone distrupting stuff in it, you owe it to yourself to try Tsi-La!
The product works as stated and much along the lines of other positive reviews. I have been using the product for about 3 months now and this is the first shower mirror that has been truly fogless. Filling the container with hot water is no hassle and it works great every time.
This is a great curling wand. Gives great curls that last for days and doesnt frizz out. I was worried that I would burn my self since there's no heat control but I got used to it pretty quickly without the need of the glove, (wish personally I dont think would have helped much anyway) Overall, a great buy!! Love the color. Also, a very nice surprise was the fact that it indeed does have a swivel cord. Even though the description says it doesnt.
Great value purchased 2 large bottles for the price of one small bottle.  My husband loves this cologne and now my son does to.
i love the seche top coat, but was disappointed in its base coat. this one is much better. it definitely strengthens my nails and prevents chipping.
These paints are colorful and really easy to use. They come with the option to paint like normal finger nail polishes OR you can flip them over and use the paint pen. The pen option works well for doing designs and nail art. I would buy some clear polish to help protect the designs though! The product is cute and worth the money.
I work outside and in Indiana in the winter time it gets relly cold. Your hands take a beating and dry up. I use this to prevent my hands from bleeding. I love this product and would recommmend to anyone.
this blush palette lasts forever because even the smallest amount is still enough. many to choose from to go with different makeup looks.  some of them are kind of orangy tho. i stick with the bronzes and pinks
This was a gift, the receiver of the was most pleased. I enjoyed shopping on Amazon, they make it very easy to purchase as many items as you wish.
I like the pigment in this colour.  I like bascially all of the NYX colours, and they have a large variety to choose from.
I got this dryer to replace my old one and wow does it make a difference.  My hair is so soft and shiny. I can even use this to dry my 1 year old daughter's hair and I couldn't to that with my old one because it would get too hot even on the lower setting. It dries fast without burning.  Definitely worth every cent!
Conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect. Transaction was smooth and quick. Excellent deal, durable product powerful and easy to use. Surprised when it arrived early next morning.
good product, this the second one we have owned. Highly recommend this hair dryer, it is like the one's used in hotels. The first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use.
pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    Definitely worth it  ... will never spend big money on a hairdryer again ater using this one!!!
Installed this for my wife, to try to keep the counter uncluttered. Good quality product.Very easy to mount, easy to use. Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway. Especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder, and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it..  Very happy
Well, I haven't used the product yet, but it's small size is perfect for packing. I'll try to remember to leave additional feedback on its use.
Love this dryer.  First saw at hotel in San Diego.  I had to have it.  Amazon had it the cheapest on the internet. I would recommend this product.
I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!
I redid my bath. Hung this on the medicine chest. love the night light. Great performace. THE BEST BLOWER EVER!  MAX
I finally replaced my old hand-me-down Conair dryer with this John Frieda dryer, and it has been like night and day!<br /><br />The significant differences are:<br /><br />- faster drying - I am pretty busy so I often find myself needing dry hair ASAP (to pick my kid up, to head outside, etc.). I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I've ever written. That said, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I didn't know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!
I love this hair dryer. I like the settings so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair. I also like the cold shot button so I can dry my hair without heat. I like the attachments with give me styling options and the metallic design is really sleek.
item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised. dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.
This is a great hair dryer.  Drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot.  I like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling.
We bought one of these two years ago, for our remodeled bathroom.  Worked perfectly, so when we moved into our new house in 2011, we bought another one.  Again, works perfectly, very convenient, very well built.   Two criticisms -- the night light is TOO BRIGHT.  A dimmer on the side would be much preferred.  AND, the wall anchors that come with it really suck.  You'll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly.    That said, we're buying another for our second bathroom.  It's a great unit.
Bought this for my mom for Christmas. Let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman, but the price and weight of this item was good. I especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty.
I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer.
It was a great deal, it's worth the price, my wife loves it. It is powerful, and until now is not heating in excess.
Even when a small problem arose, customer service was so accommodating. Very nice dryer. Excellent customer service and very prompt responses.
I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!
I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the Ferrari engine printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It's powerful but gentle, I don't smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it's a little heavy, heavier than I'm used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don't care - I love it.
I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I'm coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I'd had the dryer for more than a year!
It was more than I expected, package was deluxe and product quality is super.  I am in love with my hair dryer.
Over 10 years ago I bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip. I loved it!  When that died, I couldn't find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability.  Well, I have now! The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use. It's powerful, but compact. It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I've used to date. No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  I won't be needing another blow dryer for the next decade. And is that ever nice!
I bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from Good Housekeeping and other Amazon reviews.  It's powerful, dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did.  Only drawback - it's a bit heavy.
I love this little,lightweight hair dryer. I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant, N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own. More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage.
got this for over a month now. It is working great. I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter. I need to dry my hair before I head out. I am very satisfied with this hair dryer.
My wife love this. Its very compact with a folding handle. It has an option for warm or normal air. Much more is that it's AUTO-VOLT so you can use it anywhere. A true travel dryer/styler. Highly recommended.
I love this blow dryer!  I have gone through about five now, and of all of them this is the best one.  It gets my hair straighter and silky.  It always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect.  Also all of the attachments are great!!
Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  Hightly recommended.
I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I've tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US.
i am a hair dresser in NYC. i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so. usually i buy this one. when i haven't and i have tried other driers (and there have been many!) they are never as good as this one. if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever. it is very light, its fast, its hot. you can turn the ionic function off (which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway). it is also pretty hardy. my tools get dropped all the time. other driers crack and stop working quickly, but not this one.   you can't go wrong here, and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too.  enjoy!
The Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer I have ever had.  Compared to other dryers I have used, it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity.  It is definitley worth the $33.99 I paid for it.
It's nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials. There's definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out. Very happy with this unit. So far, this is the best hair dryer I've ever used.
I like the hair dryer very much.  My old one was really loud.  This is not at all.  Nice color.  Very pleased I bought it.
This hair dryer is the best we have found yet. It puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly. It has an easy to use mount for the dryer. Only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall, which are backward, but once mounted it is a joy.
My wife has tried many hairdryers and I couldn't believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer...  Totally worth it!
Bought for our motor home. Installed easily and works great.  It is small enough to be out of the way yet has the power needed.
Although this hair blower is small in size, it actually dries hair quite quickly.  Small size makes putting it out of sight after using really easy.  Love the Andis hair products
I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol). Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It's amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug. So I'm easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom.  I'm thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five. Every minute counts when your getting ready.
Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop.
I ordered this hair dryer on Friday, and received it on Monday! Extremely fast shipper. And the hairdryer works amazing. The air heats up extremely quickly, and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price!!!
Excellent 100% (satisfecho por la compra de este producto, sobre todo lo rapido que fue la transaccion de la compra a traves de amazon)  Trank you!
I am convinced that you need a great product to be able to straighten your hair out and have it look great.  This blow dryer has made all the differece in how fast and nice my hair blows dries straightening out!
I have finely textured, shoulder-length hair, but a lot of it, so it seems to take forever to dry it.  My old dryer was pretty heavy, so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before I could finish.  This past August, I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott while moving my son into his college dorm.  Having to pack lightly for myself, I counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided.  When I saw how small the Andis Pro Style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was, I was skeptical of its power.  I was pleasantly surprised!  In addition to being lightweight, it was very effective.  I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.  I have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems. My dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath, but it is almost as if they like this one! Of course, I do wonder how long a $14 hairdryer will last, but my hairstylist told me Andis is a very reputable brand.  Regardless, it has been worth every penny. Highly recommend!
I had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me.  I went in search of it at all the local stores.  I couldn't find it, so I bought a couple other ones that I ended up returning, because I didn't like them.  Therefore, I was pretty happy when I found this close match on Amazon.  I'm very happy with it.
I've been using it about two weeks now without any problems.  It blows a strong current of hot hair.  It takes up very little space because it is very tiny.  But being tiny doesn't mean it can't do the same job of a bigger dryer, because it sure does.
I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, and I'm glad I listened to them. This is a powerful, easy-to-use dryer. It gets the job done, and while I use styling products, it does help make it somewhat silky smooth. Definitely recommend.
Love it, love it, love it!!!  In renovating our bathrooms, we added an amenity I so appreciate in hotels.  Convenience to our over-nighters, and < in baggage weight, are both a plus to them as well. The Night light is great for the grandbabies also.  Amazon's cumulative $ point system and free shipping cannot be beat.
It was a pleasure to receive this product quickly in the mail! I'm extremely pleased with the transaction and with the hair dryer! Thank you.
I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it.
My wife needed a new dryer and bought this because of the reviews. Its on the bigger size compare to the smaller dryers which we normally use. But its a slightly quieter as it does not struggle for air. The handle do fold to help with storing it everyday. Over all, we like it and hope that it last longer than other Conairs which we used before.
Lots of power behind the air, cool shot button AND cool setting, which I love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if I wanted cool air.......
Got this for my wife-she LOVES it.  Did my research on which hair dryer to get-and the power on this one is incredible.  Still noisy (all hair dryers are), but less so then some of the previous high end ones she has used.
I love this blow dryer, I bought it because it's the one that the lady at the salon uses.  It gets really hot fast and it has four heat settings (low-cold, high-cold, low-hot, high-hot).  I use it with a round bristle brush and it staightens my thick curly hair in less than half an hour and leaves lots of volume.  You won't regret buying it.
This hair dryer is the best.  It is light weight and has two powerful heat levels.  I first used this hair dryer in a Marriott Hotel.  I loved it so much that I wrote down the name, so I could order one for myself.  So happy I did.[[ASIN:B001UE7D32 Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair Dryer]]
Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools pink zebra one broke. While it's not as cute it does dry my hair better. I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long. But this blow dryer is very light weight and packs a punch too! It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions. Overall I love it!
I found this is really worth for me.I'll definitely Prefer this drier to everyone. It dries hair    just within 5min.
i am grateful to still be able to find this type of dryer.  they are very hard, impossible, to find in a store on the shelf.  so thanks for letting us count on you to find items for us.
I have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years, but had never tried one. I'm a total convert at this point -- the T3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny, and it weighs practically nothing. It's a quiet yet very powerful little machine.
We have had walll mount hair dryers in our bathroom for over 20 years.  They work great and last a long time.  The new Andis meets my expectations for power and convenience, takes up very little space and is always easily stored.  Every family needs one!<br /><br />3/30/3013  I wish to change my review after using this product!  I bought 2 of these dryers in Sept 2011.  One was replaced under warranty after 6 months.  Both of them have now quit (one was used for 18 months, the other for 1 year).  In both cases the dryer was being used at low speed when it sudddenly smelled hot and switched to high speed.  The low speed switch apparently burned out.  I am not sure they are really safe to use after the burn smell.  I also do not like the high speed for drying my hair!  My previous wall mount dryers (both a different brand) lasted over 10 years each.  I feel this product quality is not good considering the short life of the product.  These dryers were used only about twice a week.  My dryers in the past were used daily and by a large family, so these Andis ones definitely did not last well.
Hair dryer was very easy to install and looks nice on the wall.  The design of base and cord holder keeps everything in its place.  The night light is sufficently bright for late nite visits to the john.  The dryer works sufficently and as expected.
I attached this great dryer to my wall in the master bathroom. It is secure and so nice not to have to dig the dryer out of a drawer or from under the sink. It looks fantastic and works perfectly.
Wall mounted hair dryers in hotels are so convenient.  I had tried to find one to buy in regular stores but never found one.  Looked online and selected this one because the ad said this Andis was quiet. It really is much quieter than all other hand helds I've used. I have very thick hair, and this dryer does the job easily. Happy to recommend this dryer.
This product is great. Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows. Works great and I can dry my hair right after the shower, no need to wait anymore. Highly recommended.
Amazon sent product on time as promised. Dryer is a small, compact and powerful. The new black finish is nice ... not shiny black but soft matte feel to it. Gets hair dry relatively fast. Very good for use as a travel dryer or at home.
This product is exactly what I wanted.  The dryer is just like the ones you find in your hotel room.  It is quick and powerful for drying your hair. Hangs nicely on the wall. I have also used it without it hanging on the wall. Much nicer to use when it is hung on the wall.  If you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small this is the one!
el producto es muy bueno, no tengo ningun problema con el. ya fue utilizado y esta como lo esperaba.<br /><br />the product is very good, I have no problem with it. already been used and is as expected.
My daughter uses it regularly. It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair!
This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  If you are looking for a great, no-nonsense chord at a nice price, then get this one.
This product is well made & was an excellent purchase. It is used constantly. Has variable heat setting. The night light is particularly useful in the bathroom when it's dark. I will be buying more for my other bathrooms.  Good value for money.
This is my second hair blower of the exact same model. (Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer)[[ASIN:B00005O0MZ Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer]]  I would by it again.
I ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping;I received have used it and give it 5 stars... it works fine..no issues..I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands... took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water... for $20 this is perfect!
The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good i recommend the Andis 82005.
I first tried this dryer at a time share. I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home. Now it's always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light. It just plugs in; no wiring involved. This is my second purchase; it was a birthday gift for a girlfriend. She is equally delighted by this dryer's speed.
I am so glad my other dryer bit the dust! This Dryer is the nicest one I have ever owned, It dries my hair quickly without blowing like a tornado and my hair is a whole lot less frizzy!
Exactly as described.  Powerful dryer.  Only used it two days so far, but seems to have cut my drying time.  Lighter weight than my old one.  Overall would recommend.
This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.
My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn't get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn't retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost.
OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you'll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is hot but it doesn't dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I've had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I've taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don't care because I can't live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won't regret it.
My wife described what she wanted. Found what she wanted at Amazon. It was an easy install and we're both happy!
OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn't even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used.
I love this hair dryer! I live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it's working perfectly!
the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great. that is all you need from a blow dryer!!
This is absolutely fabulous! Very lightweight and compact when it folds. Perfect for travel. Cheaper than the retail stores. Great product for the money...an awesome color too!
This is my second of this particular hair dryer.  But the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing.  Since I couldn't be without a hairdryer, I bought another one.  However, I sent in the old one to Elchim for repair.  On their website it said the repair was $20.  That was correct and for $20 I now have a 2nd hairdryer ... not that I need it since this product lives up to the hype.  This is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by.  I highly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer!
Great blow dryer! It takes half the time to blow dry my hair like my old one did and takes a lot of the frizz off too. I LOVE this blow dryer. Highly recommend it. Shipped Fast!!
This is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one I've owned, and it does it quietly.  It's also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because I blow my hair out every morning.  I told my hair stylist what I bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years.  Great feedback on the seller, too.  My order came quickly and as described. New in box.
This product works great. It dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy-that's a plus to someone with curly hair!
got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years.
This is a very nice hairdryer.  It is lightweight and I love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds.  It is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend it.  It is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip.
The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.
i think that the hair dryer is ok...i just like at picture! is not bad for the cost... is great  :D
This is a very good qaulity hair dryer.  It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  The Andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer, but retains a reasonable price.
i am a hairdresser for 20 years, i've had tried so many different blow-dryers but this works wonders on every hair types,no other blow-dryer make the hair silky and shiny like silver bird,but it will not last long ,like in two months it will brake, every two or three months i buy new one as i did not find a better blow-dryer i will keep buying it..
Very happy with product - very quite operationally. It was a bit tricky to mount on the wall, but that was probably just me.
This hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product. The sleek design, quiet operation, and versatile settings were what I was looking for in a replacement hair dryer- and this product delivers. I've only used it twice and am already in love with it.
I'm sooo glad I bought this blow dryer, it gets my African American hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier! The comb attachment is the best part, next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down. Buy this blow dryer and you won't want another one.
I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.
I wanted a hairdryer that has warm and cool settings and not just hot and hotter.  I bought it to dry my little Japanese Chin after her bath.  She hates to be wet and the Conair dries her in about 10 minutes.
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT. SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS IS A GREAT BUY,AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price.
This blow dryer is great.  Really leaves my hair soft, shiny & frizz free.  Great value for the price.  Would highly recommend.
We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  Couldn't find it in any stores so I ordered it from amazon.  After we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and I somehow made two orders.  I let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up.
I can't believe someone didn't think of this sooner! Best product I have bought in a very long time. Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it. I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!
I have had a yellow bird blow dryer since 1976. I replaced mine 7/2011 (35 years).  So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it's money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in '76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair's website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.  It comes with a comb (I don't use it anymore since I have dreadlocks) and a muzzle that narrows at the tip.      I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up.
This hair dryer is much smaller than I expected.  The smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don't have chimpanzee arms!  The machine is also really quiet and efficient.
All I need is a basic hair dryer with several heat settings.  This one suits my needs perfectly.  Reasonable price for a good product.
This is the second one of this model my wife owned.  The blower fan severed off the spindal on the last one we had.  Hopefully, it won't happen again.  Regardless, we were very happy with the price on Amazon.  The items was over $80 dollars in the salon when she bought it about a year ago.  The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons.
I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.
This dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts. If you have a 3 foot long mane of thick, beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds, forget this one, that's not the intention. Wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests. The price is good, it's easy to install and is quite functional.
This is the best Flat Iron Period!!!    I have used T3 over $200, GHD nearly $300, They work, but for $39.99 the best I have ever used.  Buy this one don't waste your money on the other brands.
Just got this and charged it overnight.  Used it with extreme satisfaction this morning.  My teeth feel great!  Set up was a breeze and using it is easy.  Everything I hoped it would be!
This is by far a Classic Fragrance from Polo.  Polo Sport, still going strong a great classic must have from the 90's.
I have tried at least 2 other products that did not work for me because I am very sensitive to chemicals and even plant materials in cosmetics. This has occured to me even with cosmetics that claim to be hypoallergenic. Eye Revival not only worked to moisturize and reduce the circles under my eyes but also did not produce any allergic reactions. I am overjoyed that I have found a product that works and that I can use long term. No more wasted time or money!
Hey Guys, I have to tell ya, i have tried many nose/ear trimmers, but by far the Philps Norelco NT9110 is the best i have ever used or bought. This Philps Norelco 9110 is absolutely the best! If you follow the instructions/ rinse and brush it out after (every use) this product will last? who knows how long. I have had mine for 2 months now, and not a problem with anything. It dose the job of trimming my nose/ear hair better than what i exspected, all i can say is, you will not be disapointed with the performance. Best regards, Greg.  p.s. Thanks a lot Phillps for making an exceptional product.
IF YOU WANT QUALITY FOUNDATION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I BOUUGHT A PHYSICIAN'S FORMULA FOUNDATION AND WOW, WHAT CRAP THAT WAS, THEIR SPONGE THEY SELL WITH THE COMPACT WON'T EVEN FIT IN THEIR COMPACT.          BUT THIS GABRIEL COMPACT IS GREAT, THE FOUNDATION IS SUPERB.
This sponge arrived sooner than expected and as described, in brand new condition. This is an amazing product and I will be purchasing again!
Instead of choosing among the four options, I decided to buy the big pony Collection Coffret so I could have then all at once.
This is the only perfume that I love.  Luckily, even though it's off the market for years, Amazon is still selling the inventory.
I have used Quantum for over 20 years - through all it's changes.  I have tried numerous other kind but always return to Quantum because it is the only one that  can handle my difficult hair. It is a great product.
These brushes seem to be near extinct. It's the only (type) of hairbrush that my husband wants and has used for a lot of years. Bought 2 just in case.
This is a really nice mild smelling body wash that certainly does wonders for dry skin. Love it. Ordered it twice,esp. at ths sale price.
great pick for servicing scuba gear.  Use it for removing O-rings.  Strong, not really bendable, which is good.
With items like this, I think most of us are creatures of habit and prefer to use what we're used to using. If it's worked well for 45 years, that's a pretty good recommendation.  That's how I feel about these Revlon tweezers. Mine - which I've really had for about 45 years, I think, mysteriously disappeared recently.  Someday they'll probably just as mysteriously reappear.  In the meantime, I couldn't find a replacement, have never been able to use the flat-edged ones, and was reluctant to spend a lot of money on expensive tweezers that get somewhat mixed reviews.  Since the latter two categories were the only types I could find in my local stores, I was glad to find the Revlon tweezers here.  And you know what? As I'm sitting here typing this, it occurs to me that, now that I know these are the real deal, I'd be a fool not to go ahead and order another pair, while they're still available, just in case my new ones disappear anytime within the next 45 years.  I think I'll do that!
Love the aroma of this little stick of perfume.  So clean, a touch of lemon and easy to carry anywhere.
This was so cheap but the product is NOT - excellent quality!!  LOVE it and use it a lot!
I'm no hairdresser but to me these clippers feel like a professional set. They're heavy and sturdy and powerful! They have a thick, no-nonsense cord. Just sturdy! Oh, and they cut hair really well too, no more catching. I'd recommend these for sure!
While US Pediatricians strongly urge parents to leave the earwax removal to professionals, people in Asia do this all the time. I was able to see the earwax with the light and gently scoop out the canal.  The big scoop and the tweezers were too big for his 9 year old ears but the smaller scoop worked perfectly.<br /><br />WARNING: DO NOT try this on yourself or go too deeply in the canal.  It's long enough to do some real damage.
This is such a great product. It is easy to apply and it does much for my lashes. No more fake lashes for me. Lash extensions does it!!!
Inexpensive product that made my hair very smooth for flat ironing, I highly recommend, loved it.  I am going to order it again.  If you order, buy two, it's not very big and you certainly don't want to run out since you will be instantly hooked.
i was really impressed with the amount of rhinestones i got and the colors on the picture here, don't do it justice! they are so much brighter and gorgeous! love it and totally worth the money!!!
lOVE THESE CLEANSING PADS - GREAT FOR TRAVEL AND SO CALMING TO THE SKIN![[ASIN:B001MBR4U0 APIVITA CLEANSING TISSUES WITH CHAMOMILE 10x0.16 OZ.]]
The best hair dryer Ive owned. It has super power and I love that it came with attachments! A must have.
I read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one. It's easy to hold because of the rubberized grip. Excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle. I have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Hopefully it will last several years.
No other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz! Love it!
This hair dryer is larger than I expected as reviews led me to believe that it was small and light, but it works very well on both low, medium and high heat and is satisfactory.
I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you.
I had seen these before in various hotels/motels. Last week I asked the maintenance person at the Place d'Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable, my favorite criteria.<br /><br />I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day. They are unbelievably easy to install, and work flawlessly. No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.<br /><br />two thumbs up.
I am so glad Amazon had this product! It is a fabulous hair dryer. I have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom.
We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we'll just have to see how long they last.
I have very thick and corse - curly/wavy hair and I love this hair dryer!! It's nice and compact but has a lot of power. It dries my hair in half the time it used to with other bigger, more expensive dryers. I first used this in a hotel I stayed at and came on here the minute I got home to order it. For me, it's been so worth it! Love this!!
I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!
The last blow dryer we bought cost almost $100.00  when it broke I headed my wife off and purchased this one from amazon and my wife said it was as good as the $100.00 one we had.
I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!
Amazon was very responsive, but the manufacturer did not mail out the product to my home in an appropriate amount of time. The distributor had to be prodded by Amazon to fulfill my request. The product is just perfect for my wife, but the delay was not pleasant.
I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  I have really thick hair and this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    [...]
My wife loves this hairdryer. It has multiple speeds and settings and even the hot setting doesn't get too hot for her. It's lightweight and not too big. Still easy to travel with also.
This blowdryer is excellent -- it can handle my lion's mane of hair. It is light to hold, easy to  hold and use and high-quality construction.  The Fekkai salon on 5th avenue NYC uses these dryers which is why I ordered it. I will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers, but it provides a generous length.
For $19.99 this is one of the best buys out there.  Wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter.  Only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one.  Small, compact and you can take it with you when traveling.
Works great! Dries my hair with no problem and my hair isn't as frizzy as it usually is when I blow dry it. Haven't had any problems with it after the month I've had it. :)
This is my second T3 dryer.  I have super duper thick hair and I can blow my hair in 1/2 of the time of any other hair dryer.  It's fabulous!
Got this for my daughter for Christmas who lives in another state and she loves it...Thanks for all your good products.
I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment.
I suggest you don't waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one.  It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good.
This compact styler is fabulous. It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space. It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.
I got the first one good so I order the second one.I'm happy with it.It's very organized.My kid love it too.
This is great.  Used them in hotels in the past.  Convenient, always know where it is and it works great.
I am seriously impressed. Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!
I don't really like hair dryers because of the noise factor and the energy use, however sometimes I need one.  I used this one at my place of employment (I teach water classes) and found it does the job. It is small enough to travel easily.
I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it's ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don't accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it's thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it's just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!
I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised. No muse and no fuse. Just a perfect buying experience. I would recommend this vendor.
This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product.
This is a great little hair dryer. I wanted a hair dryer to use for both home & travel and the size is perfect.
After years of having a long magnificent mane...I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn't enough. I LOVE this hair dryer...I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly! I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser! The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn't lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it's exactly what I got!
This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!
Love how lightweight & compact this blow dryer is!  Air concentration is great due to style/shape of the nozzle!  Easy to travel with & drys great!  It is more powerful & drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i've owned in the past.  Would highly recommend this product (& already have)!
I ordered this on Amazon from Elephant Deals. I received it quickly. The blower is fantastic. It has a steady, hot flow. It doesn't leave me with flyaways, and I don't have to use a flat iron when I'm done. It is quick and efficient. I highly recommend this blower.
As I had minimal space on our bathroom  counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way.  I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed.  As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations.
This replaced my old wall hairdryer. I Love the design and the night light is very nice to have. Very quiet when running and I have the option of changing from 1200W to 1600W. I would recommend this hairdryer.
I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout..
My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money. I recommend it for anyone--also great gift idea    UPDATE I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!
Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It's efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won't fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don't click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn't know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it's working great so far.
My 10 year-old Conair just died so I bought this model.  So far it has been perfect.  The airflow is great.  I love the temperature settings with the cool shot.  I mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect.  This works just as well as the $150 ones at the salon.
This hair dryer shaved 1-1/2 hours off my hair straightening time.  I have curly (or better yet coily) hair and this hair dryer (with the comb attachment) goes through it like butter! I highly recommend this hair dryer!
This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product.
I've used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so I consider myself a bit of an expert.  This is one of the best blow dryers I've used.  It's light but powerful and does a great job.  Highly recommended.
After having used a wall-mount Sunbeam hairdryer on vacation last summer, I really wanted one for my bathroom.  After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again.
My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  I just purchased another Jerdon Hair Dryer and I see why I bought it in the first place.  It is a terrific hair dryer!  I will buy no other.
I first saw this product at my hairdresser's salon while she was blowing drying my daughter's hair.  This product was wonderful. It made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes.  It also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural.  I also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing.  Awesome product.
I've only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom.  I had a guest visiting from England for three weeks and she loved it! She said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels.  I'm surprised how quiet it is.
I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it's frizzy & I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment & after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight & shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!
This is a GREAT product. I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders. Sometimes I want straight hair, so I'll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great! This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day. I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself. So awesome and convenient!! You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)
I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer...but a friend of mine highly recommended it..so I gave it a go.  From my frist drying experience I noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It is super quiet...did dry my hair faster, with less force and no tangling!  I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  I got a load of compliments that first day!  Worth the cash!
This is an excellent dryer! It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.  I use a smaller, folding, dual-voltage model for travel (then find that all the hotels have built-ins anyway).
I love that Andis 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer!  It's powerful enough for my short hair, but not too powerful. It's compact so it'll be great for travel.
I've always thought that the wall-mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea.  They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  Guess I know what she's getting for Christmas this year.
i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair. not too hot, and it covers my entire head. fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools!!
This hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. It would cost $200 at a retail store. She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price. I got the hair dryer for half the retail price. The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair. The best thing is that it's quiet for a blow dryer ... more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.
I am always looking for organizational tips.  When I saw this hair dryer I thought this would be perfect to cover the hole that a non operating  wall phone would leave. It is perfect and no storage problem.  Works well.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]
I use it a lot, i am a stylist and use this with my really curly hair clients and it never disapoint me. great price, great quality, great buy.
I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus.
I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.<br /><br />At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.<br /><br />UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it's working just as well as the day I purchased it.
Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model's high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.
i have limited space in my apartment..every inch counts. that doesn't mean that i don't want the best, and i have it in this teeny tiny dryer. tucks into one of my baskets when not in use, but when in use, works like a charm.
I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).
Was very pleased with this purchase.  The profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall.  It has different speeds with pleases me.  Very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one I had for years.  Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer
The hair dryer is very easy to install.  You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  While this may not be convenient or preferred for home use, in a vacation rental it keeps them in one place.
Yes, it's almost a full size hair dryer BUT it does fold and the cord retracts.  More importantly it's Powerful ... More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  AND the cold shot doesn't slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!! Annoying.  But not on this one.  Of course I'd prefer a lighter dryer with the same features but until then this one fits the bill.  I'd rather lug something a little heavy that's going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  At this price, I'll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  Good price.
Powerful hairdryer.  It doesn't have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!
I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.
I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a grippy handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it!
Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have really thick/coarse hair and have always had to flat iron my hair after drying; but not anymore!!! 15 minutes and I am ready to go!!! No flat iron necessary!!!
I had to get a second one because I was taking it to my dad's and bringing it back for my husband. Love these things. If you want a close trim without having to break out the old sharp razor (that usually makes you bleed), this is your trimmer. I use this on my dad's face. He has a very stiff beard.
It smells good, is a nice texture (not too thick, not runny), and doesn't weigh down my long, fine hair.  I rub a bit on the split ends on any stray hairs - a great grooming creme.  A little goes a long way.  Cool pink pump container, too.
Bought this for my brother for Christmas.  He really likes it.  It is now discontinued but he said that Curves is the same fragrance
i been using this face wash for last 3 years now and all i can say is this face wash does wonders, it cleared away all my acne, all my scars that were left by the acne, and made my skin way softer, of course this wasnt only because the face wash, i had to put on facial lotion as well for the acne to really go away but this face wash does what it does and not heavy on your skin compare to many other acne facial wash i tried
This lovely boxed gift set arrived on time was a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient.  The box is actually pretty enough to keep treassured trinkets in or letters or whatever.  The fragrance is very pleasant.  Very Nice
This is a great price for this product!  If your hair needs some TLC from the dry, winter air, this is a great shampoo.
I've never used a pumice stone before so when I purchased this one and used it for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised at how it worked. My tootsies were soft on the bottom like they hadn't been all winter.<br /><br />I'm so glad I purchased this. Plus, the little string allows me to hang it with my loofah.
Amazed no one has given thumbs up on this hair color product.  Naturcolor is the best permanent herbal based hair color I've ever used.  After many professional hair color mishaps, I decided to go it on my own, and that was a decade ago, when I found Naturcolor at my local health-market.  I've gotten many compliments on my highlights, and natural color.  It doesn't strip my hair, and doesn't turn it artificially yellow.  Why isn't everyone using Naturcolor?  They should. I use Sesame Blond 9N on the roots, leaving it for about 20 minutes, then I put the left overs just on the top of my hair for another 5 minutes and shampoo, and I am summer blond. You'll save a lot on stylist fees and have a more natural look.   Susan
If you are like me, the cheap cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face.  I've always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area.  These don't shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side.  Search carefully at Amazon.com to find the lowest cost.  I got mine for $19.99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when I added another free shipping product that I also wanted.  I'm happy to store these until I use them given the quality and price I paid.
The 3 jars are a much better deal and love the foam!! After 4 months hair growing in really good!!!
I have owned a makeup mirror for many years and this one is better than the other two I have owned.  This is one is more stable no matter what position you have it sitting in.
Have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product.  I especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily.
My hair stylist recommended this product, and had me start on it before I started chemo, during it, and after it was over.  Even though it was tough and sad to put on my scalp during the process, having no hair, I'm glad I did.  It sort of gave me reassurance that yes, someday I would have hair again.  After a year of having to wear a hot wig, when my hair did come back, it came back VERY strong and full!!!   I'm not real big on the minty smell, but I definitely would recommend the product, and gave it to a friend that was going to be going through chemo too.
There is no way not to recommend this product. Since the first time I used I felt the difference in my hair: it's softer and brighter. Sometimes with other conditioners, hair tends to fell, but you won't feel this with SOS Reparacion.
As a scent-o-phile, this was a classic that just HAD to be tested for my collection. Visit basenotes-dot-net to read about the legacy of this fragrance. If you like Creed's version of Original Vetiver, but find it a bit too clean and light for a vetiver, you REALLY must try Guerlain's formulation. This set is not the newest recipe, but the previous one from the 90s. Apparently the newer version is a bit brighter, but not nearly as rich.<br /><br />This starts clean with a hint of lemon and grass clippings, but quickly dries down to an earthy and slightly mineralic cedar. Final dry down is to a rich and exceptionally warm woody oak-moss with a powdery overlay. Soapy-clean permeates throughout the entire range of the scent.  This is mature, masculine and a barbershop-clean classic. Makes Creed's version seem flat and incredibly overpriced.<br /><br />The EDT miniature is splash only (no spray). The aftershave lotion smells even warmer than the EDT, due to high oil content and no alcohol. The bath gel/shampoo is a bit chemical smelling at first, but complements the cologne well enough.
Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it's not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!
I tested this hair dryer at a Ritz Carlton and loved it - didn't even unpack my own.  I ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month.  My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  This dryer is fantastic!  The retracting cord works smoothly, too.
This is a replacement wall mounted hair dryer.  I had one exactly like it that I mounted in my bathroom 13 years ago when we moved into our new home.  It is extremely handy and up out of the way.  I never have to deal with tangly cords or plugging it in.  It's powerful and efficient.  If it weren't awesome, I wouldn't have bought my second one.  You won't be disappointed.
Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife & I's master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once.
I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product.
Serves the purpose excdellent. Easy hand held position compared to other dryer are awkward to hold. I definitely would recommend this dryer and seller to a friend.
i am glad that i bought this product.its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish.its the perfect thing i was looking for.
I decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews. I couldn't be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price I paid. I have VERY thick, longer hair that used to take me 10-15 minutes to get completely dry in the past. I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer. The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description. Love the retractable cord. I'm very impressed!
I've had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I've had.
A bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones.  Definitely a good product
THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. I DID NOT REALIZE HOW BAD MY OLD DRYER WAS UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS ONE. I CAN DRY MY VERY THICK, CURLY HAIR IN NO TIME AND CONTROL ANY FRIZZ.
I am really enjoying the hair dryer and enjoy the wall mount so it hangs out of the way nicely.
First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  Bought one for home and love it.  Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.
Dryer is lightweight and delivers a lot of heat.  Dries and smoothes hair quickly. Cuts down drying time down in half.  Wont go back to standard dryers.
I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn't work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn't believe how quickly her hair dried......
I love this blow-dryer!  What a great purchase...you won't be disappointed.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  I highly recommend!
loved it
I finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so I started searching for a new one. I picked this one, and I am very happy with it so far. I use a small amount of leave-in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great! The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don't seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I've found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it's been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I'm finishing, but it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!
Very happy with my new hair dryer- great for easy drying natural curls.  the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working. I love this product so far- it is very sturdy without being too heavy. The cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy.     The hair dryer itself works great. Compared to my last one, this dries so fast! The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool. I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!
This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever used. I've been using Conair's Yellowbird for 33 years, since I was 13. After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more). My 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well. I highly recommend these blowdryers...as I said, by far the best!
I bought this as a replacement for my daughter's old compact hairdryer.  I haven't used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn't get too hot, and doesn't suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, Either I'm having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it's supposed to be!  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again.
My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it. This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  It isn't as fast as a hand held dryer but if she's reading, the longer the better. It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it's worth it.  I'm thinking of trying it out... It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height. She just keeps it set up all the time and it's become a permanent fixture in her room. Definitely worth it.
This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  Three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well.  For the money a very good purchase.
I have used the Elchim Professional 2001 for several years.  My son's girlfriend needed a hair dryer and tried mine.  She was amazed as to how quickly the Elcim dried her long thick hair.  She had to have this hair dryer for Christmas and is loving the ease of use.
So far, I have been pleased with the purchase.  If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review.
I was in desperate need of a new hair dryer. I read several different reviews on Amazon.com and decided to go with the Remington D-2012. I am very happy with my decision! I have been using the hair dyer now for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference in my hair. The dryer leaves my hair feeling really soft and super shiny.  It would be great if it was a little lighter (weight-wise) but I would not say it is heavy at all.
This is just what a hair dryer should be. Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful. I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.
awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie and then some,GREAT BUY.
En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rÃ¡pida recomiendo al vendedor
This is a nice hair dryer, like that is has three blower settings. Works well on my think long hair, easy grip handle.
Bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase, but when i did!!! OMG I totally love it! Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!! Its quiet, easy to handle and work with! Totally love it!!
This is a great hair dryer! Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market. I did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times I used it, and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight, but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product.     My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don't necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!
love this product!
Plain and simple - this is a great hair dryer.  I have my cosmetology license and have bought very expensive dryers in the past, with the same results as I've gotten with (this) Andis' moderately priced version.  I will seek out this brand without hesitation in the future.
I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.
I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It's lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn't too hot (like some I've experienced).
Amazing!! I highly recommend this blow dryer. Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny. I feel like I had it professional styled. I have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...
Purchased this for my daughter and it works fantastic!  Small size but gets the job done. Plenty of power and airflow. Areal winner!
Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died. No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!
This is perfect! I love that it is really strong, my hair gets dry pretty fast. I also like the 3 different intensities.
Great item, Lots of power came with a great price point and very fast shipping! I'm completely satisfied, thanks for offering this fine item!
We bought it not long ago, about a month. My wife like it! it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed) the sound is ok I guess. hope it will work for a long time.
Since this is a Christmas present for my granddaughter, I have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time. The service I received though was wonderful.
This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!
I know others have poo-pooed this product because you have to use water for it's application. I purchased this product along with some of it's rivals. Hands down this product was better...for the following reasons:   1) It was less messy to apply because only the part of the stick that is wet will apply color to your hair.   2) It dried quickly and didn't rub off of my hair onto my clothes and fingers easily.     I really enjoyed this product and I will purchase more of it.
This flat iron is hands down the BEST I have ever owned.  Works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight !
This is a teriffic product. I was seeing lines (road maps!) in my face and I put the oil on after cleansing my face and then cover that with collegen cream and bingo!  I could see a difference in about a week.  Love it!
As far as wound care goes, this tape is mediocre at best.  The tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off, rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place.    The one area where this tape really shines, however, is in binding orchestral sheet music parts.  The 1 Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I've found for taping orchestral music parts together.  It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly, yet not so much that it can't be repositioned without destroying your parts.  It's extremely thin, easy to tear to length, folds perfectly, and doesn't stretch at all.  It's about as sticky as masking tape, but much thinner and much stronger.    I'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound, and it has everything to do with this tape!    Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed!
The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half! I leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord.  For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  A great value for the job that it does!!
It's cheap and it works - what's not to love? Full power is pretty strong and gets my hair dry within minutes. The heat is at a good level, not too hot and not cold. There's also a cool button in case you want cool air for a moment. It's also very light, which makes it easier to use and hold, especially if you have crazy hair like I do. Some people have said it's loud, which is true, but it's not much louder than most other hairdryers. I haven't tried the attachments. Overall, it's a good hairdryer and I would buy it again.
I've always been a fan of Conair dryers, but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  I really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow.  It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced.  Highly recommended!
I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It's great and doesn't blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.
Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!
Finally a blow dryer that leaves my hair frizz free. I've tried Babyliss pro cermaix (not impressed!) and other drug store blow dryers with the ion feature. I have frizzy, thick, coarse hair and a LOT of it. Before blow drying I put garnier leave in, chi silk infusion, and a heat protectant in my hair. My hair is left smooth and for once NOT poofy and frizzy. I love it! BUT I don't think this cuts out on my dry that much.
Super easy to mount. Great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily. A tad-bit noisy but that's what a hair dryer is, loud. I recommend to all.
Yes, this looks like a hair dryer from a hotel and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of hotels used this.  It's well-built and light-weight.  Nothing fancy - on/off, high/low air and heat.
This hairdryer does what it says it does.  Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog and she needs a low heat blow dry.  I would recommend it.
The folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer.  Plenty of power and yet easy to store.  Definitely a good buy.  Have used it for about 6 months and works great.<br />2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.
Bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing.  The button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit (by necessity) and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so I could no longer retract the cord.  Other than this inherent drawback, I love that the cord retracts for safety/neatness/space-saving, etc.  Dries efficiently without being smoking hot.
the is one of the best blow dryer ever, i lov it i would recomended it to everyone...try it you too will love it!!!
I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn't be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can't go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus.
The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  It is a little heavy and I definitely would not refer to it as compact - it's about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it's heavier as well.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time.
I installed this little hair dryer because I was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter -- it always seemed to be in the way.  My concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught.  Excellent hair dryer, plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair (like my GF).  Easy to mount -- love the hook to hang the cord on.
I bought the Conair Blackbird to replace a similar older model that I had for many years.  I know that there a lot of new-tech hair dryers out there. For my needs; I didn't need the new technology.  I wanted to replace my old Conair with a powerful and modern version of the original.  I'm very pleased with the Blackbird.  I'm a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week.  I don't have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.          This is the first time I've reviewed a product...I'm so pleased with the Blackbird that I wanted to share.  Starlight
I really am very pleased with my purchase of the Conair 225RX tourmaline Ceramic 1875 Watt hair drier.  It dries my daughter's long thick hair much faster than my old drier.  It produces a nice strong hot breeze, yet it doesn't get too hot that she complains of it burning her (on lower heat seting).  Her hair seems shinier too.  Whole family loves it!!!  Highly recommend it.  The price was reasonable also!!!
I was looking for something compact and light weight and this was smaller than I expected it to be! Does a great job in drying my hair quickly. The high mode is a bit loud but if you don't want to use high, the low option works good too.
I've only had this hair dryer about a month but so far it is excellent.  It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it's easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.
My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money.
This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It's also very lightweight. On cool and warm it's not  too hot.  And it's very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I've ever used. So if you're looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won't be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you're own hair it's just fine.
the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat. you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer.
I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!
This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!
I bought this blow dryer for my camper.  It is perfect.  It's compact, hangs on the wall, not loud and does the job.  I would recommend this product for campers, boats, etc.  I will buy another when I burn this one out.  A girl's hair still has to look good, even when you're camping!
I've owned various blowdryers through the years, but this one is my favorite by far. It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.     After my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer, so I knew it was reliable. The way I see it, I wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face, so it's worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance. I highly recommend this dryer!    And by the way, I purchased it from someone on Amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars. It was a great value and I've had no problems with it!
This dryer works like it should.    The dryer has an ionic on/off switch, which was the only reason we bought it.
This blow dryer did everything they said it would do. My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon with that salon finish everyday! It is shiny like they said it would be and it is not damaging to my hair at all. This is a great blow dryer for someone to use in their home once or twice a day but I would not recommend this blowdryer for salon use because it does start to feel a little heavy after a few minutes so I couldent see a stylist holding this dryer for 8 hrs a day which is unfortunate cause it is a GREAT dryer!!
I love this blow dryer...it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button.  For those going natural this is a great choice!!
Not much to say here ... this is a small hair dryer perfect for travel; I wanted it to keep in our RV.  I have a lot of hair and it's completely dry in 4 minutes with this little guy.  Very happy with the purchase.
This is the best hair dryer. I usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers, but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair. I'm so glad I did!! This dryer dries my long hair in about 5-7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth. I hardly have to use my flat irons; which saves my hair even more from heat damage. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference!
light weight, effective hairdryer. like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes. retractable cord nice feature. wish it had a cool setting or cold shot button. overall, great dryer at a terrific price!
I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.
This little hair dryer was just what I was looking for!  It is small and light weight, just right for me.  I also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit! All in all a great price, too.
I am a flight attendant and this travel dryer is powerful!  Better than any hotel hair dryer.  I love it and it's cheap.
I like it so much. Even the button is kind of easy to accidently push, but I don't think it's a big deal.
I recommend this dryer 100%. Really a good product. I dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight.
This hair dryer is the best I have ever owned. I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  It all worked out for me. The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz. It held my style in place.  I gave it 5 stars because I am am very pleased with this purchase.
I am very happy with this hair dryer. Its light weight. poweful, but doesn't burn the hair. a great buy for any professional.
This is a great little dryer.  I have fine hair and it's nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.
I was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser, You see I had one for 20 years, and it finally blew up, I had loved it so much I had to find another one, I was so happy with my purchase. I use it about 10 to 15 times a day, I am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment. Thank you for my dryer.
Bonnet size is perfect. 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry. It's not noisy. It work very well and never turn off.  Bought it was a good decision. I use it while I watch TV or read.
Love it.  Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.
I like the three temp. and three levels of air pressure. It makes a big difference I can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat.
No bells and whistles on this hairdryer - just an excellent product. Very powerful and light to hold. It arrived very promptly and I recommend it.
i love it, it gets the job done.  it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers.  i recommend it for anyone.
I place my order on Wednesday September 1st and I was shocked that I already got it today September 4th; I am very pleased with them because I need it the item right away and I got it without paying extra money for rush delivery.  I won't think twice to buy again from them and I Would definately recomend them to everybody.  Excellent Packing and professionally well done.   TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS.
This is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years.  The newer model is great I would highly recommend it as I have to many friends.
Used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it -- had to order -- great price -- great travel hair dryer folds nice.
This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again.
I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.
This hair dryer is wonderful.  Drys my hair much more quickly than the Conair dryer I purchased at Target.  Very sturdy.  Would recommend it as a great investment in hair care.
I asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used- which is this one. She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn't believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don't think a dryer makes a difference - I'm telling you this one did for me. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.
this blow dryer was in a hotel room i was staying at. i fell in love with it it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful i love it!!!!!!!!!!
This Conair Pro is one of the few hair dryers that still uses a squirrel cage blower fan. This type of fan puts out a lot more air than the prop style for the same noise level. This is a Pro quality dryer with a heavy duty motor so it weighs a little more than a regular unit. It does the job fast.
I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    The wife loves them!
For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!
Bought this item for my husband who is on his feet 24/7 and has difficult toenails and a sore ankle.  Applying the balm to his ankle definitely seemed to improve blood circulation as the pain diminished and the 'black and blue' appearance also normalized.  I figured I would try it on my extremely dry skin - even on my face after a day working in the backyard.  It was very soothing and not greasy at all.  Dry, dead skin that I couldn't even see flaked off and fine lines are smoother.  I will definitely recommend this - easier to use than Euciren - and goes a long, long way.
I prefer woven floss, but could not find on shelves anywhere.  So glad to be weaving again instead of waxing.
I used this on my husband's back, and while yes, it hurt (HELLO, you're pulling the hair from the roots, of course it hurts!) it did a great job at getting all of the hair.  It didn't leave much of anything behind and I never had to redo any spots.  I did my husband's entire back and went through an entire thing of wax (although we had tons of strips leftover), just so you can judge how much you might need.  Oh, and it smells good, too!
All three shades work beautifully. However if you are fairer complected. Stick with Bare your Soul and Look on the Bright Side. This one is a bit corally with a ever so slight shimmer. Its all sheer and will work but would just look better on Asian/African American/Latin skin tones. You can't go wrong so don't sweat the exact shade.
I have been using this for a year, love it.   I leave the 1st application on my hair for 40 min to cover gray completely. This will make your hair more reddish than the color of your choice so be careful. I use color black, so the finish is warm brown (my natural hair color is dark brown)   you will need disposable gloves and cap, and some plastic sheet to cover your floor.
Thank you for the great product, and the wonderful samples for tanning.  I now know where to go to purchase products such as this...  Nice touch
This mirror is awesome for plucking stray hairs and seeing what's going on up close on your face.
This is the next best thing to a massaging chair. I found the cushion works best when used in a recliner.
I have achieved healthy-looking non-frizzy hair by rubbing this oil over my hands and cuticles, and then running my hands through my hair. A little of this stuff goes a long way. I also love that this product has no fragrance- it is practically odorless, which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother. Its a great product. Would buy it again.
I am verry happy with Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer!    I was a faithful user of Nivea Spray-On Moisturizer for several years. Unfortunately, Nivea discontinued this product.    After an internet search, I located Body Time Spray-On Natural Body Moisturizer, and immediately ordered two bottles.     In my opinion Body Time is better than Nivea. I will continue to purchase this product, and I have recommended it to my girlfriends.    Renate Wagner
I have fine black hair and I love this product.  I spritz it on before blow drying.  I can definitely tell the difference when I don't use it.  It adds body and it feels light.  To keep the volume I use Elnett hairspray to finish the look.
I have oily skin on to of dry skin, therefore, makes it very hard to find a good skincare line. I get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin (normal/oily). Face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin. Finding good all natural skincare is even harder. I use Pangea Organics line for the day time. I use this oil for night because I wake up with very oily and very dry skin. Using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer. It's hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops. So, I mix this in with my Pangea Organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed-looking skin. I haven't tried using this oil in the day time since I get the midday oil slick, but I hear Argan Oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin. Here's another bonus, my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon, like as if I just ran a marathon. Using this Argan Oil reduced the redness.     One of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free, instead will try one that has the fragrance. I don't doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by Slice of Nature says that there are 3 processing types for Argan oil. One of them is make Argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear. The other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker AND it is mostly used for cooking, maybe for cosmetics. I personally don't want to put cooking oil on my skin, since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly. That's like saying that I will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body. Would you do this? This one from Watt's Beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper, which is very useful.     As always with any consumer products, it's always either you like it or you don't. I personally like this and will continue to use it.    I haven't tried using this on my hair or on my body. My hair is pretty normal. I do intend on using this with my body lotion very soon.
Thank you!! the cream was delivered earlier than expected ..and it works so well, my scars lightened noticeably within a weak..now it can hardly be seenn!! I will definitely buy from you again!!!
If you love vanilla, you will love this essential oil! I'm glad I bought this
I had purchases matte polish previously so i know that it doesnt last as long, but its better than what other reviews are saying. I love the color and the matte finish is great! I have been wearing it for 4 days and no chips so far! You just have to put one thin coat on and it wont come of in huge flakes.
At first I was kind of scared to get one of these for cheap, bc I'm scared to get cut. But fortunately this price is great, and it works FANTASTIC. I love it!!! And it comes with 10 replacement blades! It's a great deal!
Very happy with the seller, the product is awesome too. The seller had this to me from CA before I got the shipment notification!! Very please will shop again.
The item i received was perfect for what i needed it for. I am making a costume for my sister. Fairly sturdy and comes with ribbon around it. A cute touch. Very cute and perfect for a costume. Not so sure about a formal event since it is felt but i was very happy about my order. Ordered from 911costume. Very fast shipping.
After several failed attempts trying to buy a Remington Shortcut that would hold a charge, I stumbled onto the Philips Norelco QC5170. It is by far the best hair clipper I have ever owned.   First things first...this baby holds a charge! It has over an hour of run time on a full charge. And if the charge does run out, it works with its AC charger plugged in. So you're never stuck with half a haircut and a dead set of clippers.   The cutter is powerful. The blades move fast so they don't pull your hair, they cut it.  Its adjustable cut settings and its pivoting spacer comb combine to produce a great, easy haircut. I also use it to trim my beard. The primary spacer comb easily pops off for easy cleaning, or to attach one of the specialty combs and cutters that also come with it.  I enthusiastically recommend this product.
I found this product by accident while trying to find a certain brand of make up on Amazon & because of the price & reviews I decided to purchase it for my 17 year old daughter, who is really into pretty eye shadows.. I have spent a fortune on colorful name brand eyeshadows at the store!    I have to say, my daughter LOVES this eye shadow! I just purchased 2 more of these eye shadow palettes (one for me & another for her) & will continue to buy them! The palette came wrapped tight in bubble wrap & all 88 shades were in perfect condition! I also love the way they are packaged, slim enough to throw in your purse but large enough when you open it that you can easily use the inside mirror to put on the eye shadow, and talk about color options, WOW! They are very vibrant, beautiful colors. It would also make a great affordable gift for anyone you know who loves to have fun with eye shadow!
Simply put. Youngest daughter wouldn't stop. tried everything. 2 days!!!! it's tastes horrid, and doesn't go away equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there.
I've been using henna hair dye for a few months now.  My hair feels so much healthier than when I used regular hair dye.  It's a bit messy using it, but you adjust and I am pleased with the final outcome!
It's a great item. It dries SUPER quick! I never have to waste time waiting for nail polish to dry AGAIN! YAY!!!
We've only used this a few times but we have not gotten sunburn at all and I can feel pretty good about the ingredients, especially for kids.
I love it. Bought it with book on makeup and I use it to create beautiful styles. It has blush, liners and eyebrow quality colors. Then lots of eyeshadows.  I really love it and enjoy every color.
I am in love with WEN!  I have very thin hair and was starting to loose a little every week or so.  It has stopped falling out and my hair looks and feels great.
I ordered this on 8/2 recieved it priority mail on 8/5.... That is great customer service. I ordered all three kinds of units because I wanted it to be convient for my son(with new braces) to use.  I installed redibreeze and the quick breeze in two different bathrooms.  Both were easy to install... worked great the first time.  Have not installed the shower unit yet  but expect it to be just as easy.  This is a great product... works really well to clean my between my teeth and the holes left by wisdom teeth removal.. Easy for my son to use with his braces.... I have not used a waterpik but cannot imagine how it would work better.  My only idea for the company might be to make a model that you can insert salt tablets or other kind of dissolving disinfectant into so you can get a salt water spray.   Along the same ideas they use for car washing.       Thanks for a great product... and Thanks for fast delivery
Derby Extra razors are the perfect razors for a beginning double edge shaver. I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.<br /><br />The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they're not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.<br /><br />If you're just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades. The only reason I'll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging. Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped. I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic boxes.<br /><br />When packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there's good product in there. Recommended for beginning shavers, or anyone looking for a good workhorse blade.
I was so glad to find my color online, because they no longer stock it in my area.<br />Thanks, the items was in great condition when it arrived. Cost a bit more than in the store (was about $8 each here).
Definitely effective for seborrhoeic dermatitis.  My only complaint is that its expensive.  However, the bar lasts forever.
I originally purchased this product for sunburn relief and loved it.  It is the one product that not only helped ease the pain and discomfort of sunburn, but you don't have to rub the product into sensitive sunburnt skin.  It absorbs into your skin in seconds!  What a relief!  I also found other uses for it.  In the winter, when dry skin is more prominent, just spray it on and it has the same relieving effect.  Now, I don't even buy hair conditioner - it even works as that!  So for around $9.00 a bottle, you really have 3 products in one!  What a bargain!
I am using all the Obagi line and is an excellent product. You can see the results within a week from using it. I ordered as a standard shipping and I got the product in 2 days. Excellent service by the way.[[ASIN:B001CJJ5WC Obagi Nu-Derm #4 AM Exfoderm Forte Exfoliation Enhancer, 2-Ounce Bottle]]
I have used home blonding hair color for over 30 years, having used every imaginable product on the market.  Dream Blondes is by far the BEST and is the only product I use.  It contains a pre-color conditioner, enough color for long hair (no more having to purchase two boxes of other coloring), and CONSISTENTLY provides beautiful color with excellent conditioning.  The Amazon price is 1/3 of the discount or drug store price! I purchased a case when I saw the price and am going to order another!!!!  What a great bargain for the best product!!  Thank you Amaon!!
I was extremely happy with the promptness of my order and delivery. (which was free) I am still waiting on my order I placed 3 weeks ago for the same product through BeautyDepot. Haire Supplies is a very professional business who will continue to have my business from now. Amazon is just great with whatever you order, they know who to do business with!
I purchased this watch for a legally blind, elderly friend of mine. The watch is just like the one Radio Shack use to sell. This watch is far superior to the new watch Radio Shack is selling. It can be heard loud and clear, and it is easy to use. I would recommend it for any one with vision problems.
This is a great product.  Although a bit pricey a little goes a long way and I love the way it helps your hair dry faster.  Not sure how it works, but it does.  Although the product says it is oil my hair is never greasy feeling and feels great! I would certainly recommend it for longer hair.
My hairdresser recommended this oil while I was at the shop one day.  She stated it was the only product from which she got results after chemo.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  I don't have frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down.  Not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin.  The fragerance is clean and fresh.
When i had moved in with my gf, she had brought along one of those cheap Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrushes. She had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads, so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene. Well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush. Well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head. The Oral-B only has an on and off function, so there is no calming down the motor in it. The floss action was just to hard on my teeth. I am a young guy, but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth. So i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around. When i got it i went home after work and tried it out. Wow what a difference between this and the floss action, as well as just a manual toothbrush. I didnt get any pains at all from using it, and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it. I can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself. I would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode.
This product has delivered higher results than I expected. This was my third purchase; I take the recommended six tablets per day; I'm in my fourth month of using this supplement and I plan to continue with it, indefinitely. Initially, there was a substantial weight loss - a little too much for me - but I've since regained what I needed. My fine hair seems no thicker - but - where there was a noticeable receding hairline, all the hair has regrown and that sure is wonderful. Complexion and fingernails show nice improvements, but the most remarkable for me is that I no longer need to wear supports for my ankles when I'm active. I suffered a degree of permanent damage to the tendons in both ankles many years ago, to the point that I had to be careful just getting out of bed in the morning. Now, I am pain free and enjoy wearing the shoes of my choice.  Overall, I credit this product with substantial improvement to the quality of my life and I would highly recommend giving it a try.
This is very nice product. Quality is quite good, and save you from risk of missing pills.   Very handy and portable
I was actually wearing this color when I had my daughter (who is now 2), so I have an emotional connection.  Honestly though, it is a great color.  If you are familiar with OPI you know it is a quality product.  The color is very girly without reminding you of little girls.  It has the maturity behind it I guess you would say!  I love love love it and I was so glad to find it as it is discontinued!
I have been searching high and low for a moisturizer that won't leave me feeling like a greased up pig. I have tried several, including a myriad of non-greasy moisturizers. So far, nothing has worked as advertised. My dermatologist recommended this. Miraculously, this actually absorbs within minutes, and does not leave a greasy feeling at all. Of course, there is a trade-off. If you have very dry skin, you will have to use this 3-4 times a day to really be effective. Less, if your dryness isn't that bad. It has no smell, and won't aggravate acne. Really tho, the only thing I care about is how fast it absorbs. As long as I use it regularly, it keeps my skin nicely moisturized. I definitely recommend this to anyone who also needs a non-greasy moisturizer.
I bought this product because I have the hair serum, which I liked also, and smells nice.  I tried the shampoo today and being that today is an extremely humid day, the product held up nicely.  My hair had no tangles and smells so pretty.  I will purchase this again.  When I began shampooing I felt my hair was not feeling dry and all tangled like some others I've tried, and I've tried all the well known ones.  It felt soft and shiny.  Kind of silky.
This is my second time buying Ivory Caps - I went wiith the 3 bottles deal this time. I had taken it for about 2 months and had noticed a great difference not only in the reduction of dark spots and uneven skin tone but also in the smoothness and texture of my skin.  I appears smoother and softer especially on my face.  My skin appears healthier and a small scar above my eye appears lighter and less noticable.  I take 2-3 capsules daily with a glass of orange juice for the vitamin C content.  I find this works best. People, this is the real deal! I would absolutely recommend this product.
This is a marvelous shave!! Nothing else that I have ever used is anywhere near as comfortable! Use it with a Gel Lather and you will never ever again feel the discomfort of Razor Burn no matter how hard you work, or workout, and prespire...EveR!!!
I love love love this color.<br />When i put it on it's like Christmas on my fingers. It's a dark red with red very thin glitter, a perfect match to Dorothy's shoes!<br />Application was great, you only need two coats. I was nicely surprised by the wear and tear, after 5 days I hardly had any tear.<br />It really is a fabulous color than you can wear on your hands or toes, summer or winter and that I think is safe for work. It's sophisticated with a little surprise.<br />I highly recommend!
Delivery is fast! I received the item in excellent brand new condition. This flat iron does what it says and even more. It cuts half the time of straigthening my daughters hair. Leaves it very shiny and natural looking without the hassle. It heats up very fast and the temperature is adjustable to fit anyone's type of hair. I love it!!!
I bought this for my mom who had been looking for Shalimar bar soap for ever!  Glad I found it online.  It is so scrumptious smelling!
I've been using this hand cream for years and I've tried others, but this is still my favorite.  The bottle is a convenient size--I keep one in my desk at work, one in my purse, etc.  The lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all; rather, it's thick and absorbs relatively quickly.  Additionally, I'm sensitive to products with added scents, so I love that it really is fragrance-free.
Finally, a nail file that does the job the first time!  I had tried cheaper glass nail files (Revlon) and the abrasive surface wore off and it no longer worked.  The Opi file works great and has lasted.  I just reordered more as gifts.  Try it.
I purchased this a few months ago and LOVE IT!  I can't claim that it drastically cut down my drying time (I towel dried pretty thoroughly in the past), but it's a great size and absorbs well.  I can put my hair up after my shower and it actually stays put!  It was money well spent.
My mother is allergic to both amonia and peroxide. She has been using this product for more than 6 months without any allergic reactions the color stays in longer than some of the similar products she previously used. We have had problems finding this product in stores so purchasing online is an excellent option and saves a whole bunch of time in trying to find it.  The package was received before the estimated time stated on Amazon which I also think is excellent.
This toap coat saves my life! Every time I feel disappointed by a nail polish, i put one coat of Orly glosser and it's like a new polish. It gives a very clean and bright finish to all kind of shades and textures. It makes the nail very shiny and smooth.<br />I protects from the wear and tear as well, but I think there is better out there if this is the only reason you're wanting a top coat. However if you want a top coat that brings the best of your polish, this is it!
This has been a favorite perfume of mine for a long time.  Many years.  Spicy floral aroma, not too strong.  The problem is that Oscar de la Renta no longer makes this scent, so essentially we're buying what was manufactured ?? years ago.  Eventually there will be no more.  And eventually I suspect the remaining bottles will not be as full-scented as they once were.  That also means you can't get the lotion or dusting powder anymore.<br /><br />So get it while you can... or not, because I'm still using it and don't want to run out!
I love the smell of this and it lathers up perfectly. Unfortunately I was allergic to it. If not for that I would use it forever.
i am very picky when it comes to my blow dryers. I can't commit. My sister had purchased this item at Target and I loved it! It has great power for it not being a professional hair dryer. I searched for it at 3 Targets and found out they no longer carried it. i was browsing on Amazon and found it! I ordered it immediately. I am very happy I purchased this item.
This floss is the kind recommended by my dentist and I can't find it in stores anywhere.  Target used to have it but not recently.  Decently priced online, and good service on delivery.
I have WHITE blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I'm vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  I can now go to the water park, the pool, the beach, etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara (that destroys your lashes anyway).    It was easy & fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it's messy for you, you're using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair's cuticle. Once that's done, it's just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn't make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it's still going strong.  I'll probably do a touch up in another week or so. I'm very happy with this product. I wish I'd found it 20 years ago.  I can't imagine not having this in my beauty arsenal. Now that I've discovered it, I'll never be without it again.
I love this conditioner.  It lasts long and its a great detangler for African American hair.  I detangle my hair while the conditioner is in it and it and it stays that way once I wash it out!
My dentist recommended this system over all others, and I can see why after using it.  It feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush!  Up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price.  Now, with the price cut in half, I could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house.<br /><br />The sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation UV lamp (254 nm) - the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use.  I've had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp.  You get two indications that it is working, a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened (then it goes out) - plus the philips logo lights up from the UV inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the UV glow of the lamp.<br /><br />This is a good system for children, as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth, and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous.  My dentist recommended it to me, and I recommend it to anyone who doesnt't want to see their dentist as often!<br /><br />Positives:  It charges using an induction charger - meaning there are no exposed wires.  A coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush.  When they are in close proximity (2) they couple energy from the AC line to the brush under charge.  This is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush.<br /><br />Negatives:  The system has one li-ion battery.  Once it expires, philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush, thus guaranteeing you will buy another one.  It would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics, which are very robust.<br /><br />Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.  It's like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear's top load models in efficiency and economics.t.    Of all power toothbrushes, this is the most efficient and professional.

Very pleased with the product and with Amazon's system. Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly. Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.
I came from other contry. Our contry use only 220 voltage. When I come back to my contry, I want to use this hair dryer. And when I travel abroad, this will be very helpful. Good product!! Buy it!
I was happy to buy another Elchim dryer.  My first one died after about five years of using it regularly.  I used my T2000 as a spare until I found a good deal on a new Elchim.  Elchim is far better than the T2000.  I have mid to long blond (colored) hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly.  My hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry.  This dryer gives me the look I want for my hair -- long and smooth.  Amazon had the best price on it.  The price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store.
My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don't like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don't go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It's light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!
Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great, we are very satisfied.
Handy product for B & Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.
This hairdryer is the best I've had yet.  Its not too noisy, its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight.  I blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired.  I would buy it again.
I have used this product before and it is so great that I bought it for gifts. Don't let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar. Your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers. Your hair will stay healthy and will shine.Found the best price on Amazon, it was half the price I found elsewhere.
this product has been awesome so far. it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers. love it!
I read the reviews before making a decision.  The one negative review was wires shorting out..but I know you shouldn't wrap cord tightly around the dryer.  It's powerful and it works!
I was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel!  I literally ordered one from my hotel room, immediately after using the dryer.  Works really well! Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  Great space saver.
This drier gives me another proof that how Amazon.com helps me find the best product.    Simple design, great quality, compact form factor, for $14 you simply cannot find a better one.
I bought this to bring with me to Europe. The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer dried my hair pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend!
I never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful. I should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that I bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers. Now I know.
it does what it supposed to do. don't know what else to say than that.
I was surprised to see how fast this dryer was shipped. I was looking for a small hand held drier due to haveing RA in both wrists I have a very hard time useing a bigger hand drier. This drier was the perfect size for me.
Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!  Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  This is an upgraded version.  I've read that some people think that it's loud but I don't notice it.  Sounds just like the ones in the salon to me!
The best hair dryer I've ever used. cut my drying time in half and I have a lot of hair!
I love love LOVE this blowdryer! It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair... Im African American so its hard to find a dryer that wone FRY my hair... it leaves it feeling light and airy.
I moved and left my hair dryer so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  Clark
Just what I wanted/needed...  I read the other reviews to make my decision,  they were right on,,,  Thank you
This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  It has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It was worth every penny!!!!!
I have owned an Andis hair dryer before and loved it- I had to leave it when I sold my home.  I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased.  It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night.  I would highly recommend this dryer.
A few years ago, I used a First Class hair dryer that was provided in the Marriott Hotel and loved it. When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!
Its a small blow dryer but it does the job great like a bigger blow dryer would.In this case size does not matter because it does the job.
I have been looking for a small, low voltage, hair dryer for some time. Went to Napa with some friends, and this hair dryer was in the Hotel. I used it, loved it, wrote down the name and found it at Amazon.com. Ordered it and it came within days. I have thin hair, and this is best for me.
It is great to have this --- just like the hotels!  A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  Extremely convenient!  No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband's plug-in for the hair dryer...Usually, I would just say 'forget-about-it'!    Love the product!
Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has been using it on daily basis. I am glad that she loves it.
My daughter recently bought this hair dryer and let me dry my hair with it.  It dryed my thick shoulder length hair in  a little over 5 minutes. I love it.  My hair has a little wave in it, in the wrong places, and this straightens that out if I use a wide round brush with it. It does get rid of the small amount of frizz I have.  My daughter has long, frizzy, thick hair and she found this dryer to dry quickley and smooth down her hair.
Been taking it for a couple of months now, and it's most definitely working for me.
I purchased this for a rental house we have, but used it myself when I installed it. It works great, lots of power, dried my hair quickly - and that's saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry. Installed quickly as well. I thought the cord could be a titch longer but I didn't feel it was so short that I couldn't comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror. Overall, a great product for a great price.<br /><br />UPDATE: It's now been 9 months since I purchased and installed these in our rental home, and they still, after heavy usage, work great. No signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report.
I bought this razor for my Dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97!  It works really great for him: shaves beautifully and is well designed.  You will not be disappointed with this shaver.
I have frizzy thick hair and using this product makes it more manageable. Adds shine and softness.. not oily/heavy.. love it.
So since this isn't sold by amazon, I'm mainly reviewing the seller (Wish4Star).<br /><br />I received this order in a timely fashion (it's shipped standard USPS and so took a few days... maybe 5 or so). All the items in the pic showed up and the packaging was compact and secure.<br /><br />However, upon going through all the razors (great selection of blades BTW), I noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened! Yuck!! So I contacted the seller and he assured me this had never happened before (I have a feeling he's telling the truth) and that he would send me a new box asap. Well I just received my replacements (yeah he sent an extra pack!), which showed up quite quickly.<br /><br />So all in all I trust this seller & had a very positive experience with him. I will most likely be purchasing in bulk from him once I settle on a single brand of razor.
These pony tail holders are a good strong weight to hold my heavy hair without breaking hair. The item arrived in 3 days from across the country. It is just a described; good quality. This store is so great because they don't charge shipping fee. Other web sites charged a fee equal to or even more than the cost of the product! I recommend this store and the product.
Product is a nice beigey gloss,cannot find it in the stores anymore so I came to Amazon
I feel so silly ordering toothpaste from the internet, but none of my local stores stock this gel bottle version anymore! Our local pharmacy usually has the Cinnamon Rush in a tube, which is okay, but I really prefer the texture of this gel. And the multi-pack price is really generous (at least compared to what toothpaste sells for individually at retail).
I recently purchased [[ASIN:B000Q6V1UG Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline]] and found that the heated clips with these Remington rollers did not hold the roller in place, UNLESS I stayed really still, and that's not going to happen in the a.m.<br />The heated clip that remington has is a great concept, but the smooth, heated surface also makes it more slippery on dry hair.  So I ordered these Conair clips because they said they were large, and could withstand heat.  So now in addition to my heated clips, or in leiu of.. these were the perfect answer!  You can't heat these clips in the Remington unit, but they can withstand the very hot velour rollers, as well as blow-dryer heat.  They also can hold a jumbo size roller, large enough a roller for someone like me with really long and crazy curly hair that needs to be tamed! No slipping at all, and no crease marks with rollers!
Packaging was excellent, this is exactly what I was looking for, great for day time (using light colors) and for night time of course using dark shades. This is a great product with great price.<br /><br />I originally wanted to by bare escentuals eye shadows but they are bit expensive, especially if you are not going to use such eye shadows that are needed for (Pakistani/Indian wedding) parties, then do not buy something expensive as mac or bare escentuals, no doubt mac and BE got great makeup but its too expensive.<br /><br />So I definitely recommend this makeup because its good, stays on and great price!
I bought this to take on Spring Break and it was great! It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast. I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes. It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer. The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually. I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!
Great price and it works great too.  Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear. It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others. I really like the three speeds . I'm going to order another for our other bathroom.
These were purchased for a vacation home. I wanted something that could be mounted off counter - like in a hotel.  They seem to work well, but I don't know how long they will last, with renters. Only time will tell.
I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it.  I had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why I bought this one.  I have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug-in inside the closet.  I hang the dryer in there out of sight so when I take it out to use, it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and I need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me.  So if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit, but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you.
Excelente! This dryer is light, strong, it makes hair shine, cuts half of the time of drying. I'm a professional and I definetely recomend it for professionals.
This is a great color and an unbelievable price for this product.  It's quieter than my last hair dryer, which is a huge bonus.  It does smell funny when drying for about the first two weeks, but then it's fine.  I've recommended this hair dryer to others I know.
It's expensive, but worth every penny, it seems. Has an extra long cord. I don't know what all the fancy technological issues are but when my wife says I love it it gets five stars. The cheap hair dryers we used to buy would work for a few months then die - this one seems to be made to last for years.
I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before).
The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  The high air flow is also a plus.
I first discovered this well-functioning hair blower at a hotel where I was staying.  The lightweight, sleek design hair styler seemed to have a higher heat output at a lower wattage than any models I had owned.  I purchased one from Amazon when I returned home and as usual, received my items in record time.  The hair styler is a pleasure to use and I especially like the heat options and focus of air (without attachments) that allows me to get the job done efficiently.
I love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn't frizz my hair out. The plug fits into my outlet well, my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces. After reading some reviews on the T3 and hair stylist using this product I committed. It is pricey but worth it to me.
This is my second Andis, it worked so well when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  Hopefully it'll last as long as the first one.  A great deal for the price.
I bought 2! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath. It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much! And since it's out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  I LOVE it! I would recommend it to anybody with kids.
I spent a lot of time comparing the features and benefits of different hair dryers before buying this one. I have a Babyliss and like it, but wanted to try something new. I didn't see a big difference initially, but when I used this and the Babyliss on alternate days, I was amazed at how quickly the FHI drys my hair. I can exercise in the morning before work because this cuts down the amount of time I need to get ready. It is lightweight and quiet, and I  hope that it lives up to its claim to have a longer life.
It does everything it says it will - nice drying, not too hot, very even, and the attachments work well.  The heat is very even and it does a good job.  This is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair.  I love it!
I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend's house so I didn't have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price.
Peroxyl isn't available where I live. The shipment was slower than I expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame. The product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist. It shouldn't be used without a dentist's approval.
I'm really pleased with this product and hope the Dial in this scent will remain available for purchase over time. I use antibacterial liquid pump soap in both kitchen and bath, but prefer a non-medicinal and non-floral scent. The scent of this is very light and smells exactly like apples in the autumn, with just a light hint of spice in the background. The product lathers up very well, but rinses clean easily, leaving my hands soft and feeling healthy and refreshed, but not at all greasy like a moisturizer usually feels. The scent lingers only for a little while and does not make me feel like I am leaving it behind in foods I prepare after washing my hands. I've had guests over since I bought this soap and both times they commented on what a lovely scent it had when they washed their hands in the bathroom. This is my favorite so far in any of the types and scents available from standard brands of liquid antibacterial soaps in a pump container. I also love that I could buy in volume at a good price, so as to not run out suddently. I would recommend this product highly for those who prefer antibacterial liquid soaps, but aren't fond of flowery or medicinal scents.
When I ordered the anti-aging eye roller I thought, yeah sure, this will be like any other product that advertises the reduction of eye bags and puffiness. But, and I mean a big BUT, I found that it really does reduce the appearance of bags and puffiness.  I am glad I tried it and I am glad it is an OLAY product because I use OLAY exclusively for face and body.  Anyway, I would and have recommended this product to others so they can try it and other OLAY products.  I don't mind asking, because I am on a fixed income, for coupons, very substantial coupons for OLAY products.  I also like the regenerist moisturizer which I use at least twice a day.  Thank you.
This eyeliner is the best! It's truly waterproof and yet not flaky, creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped applicator!<br />LOVE IT!!!
My boy does not like when I put any cream on his face. He does not mind Mustela Dermo-pediatrics stelaprotect. Skin is so smooth and smells lovely. I can only recommend it!
I have really dry hair and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair. Easy to use, apply before blow dry. I noticed a difference the first time I used it. I have been using it with the Moroccanoil.
I had purchased this item years ago at an Origins store, not even noticing the brand name. I wanted to replace it and when I saw this on Amazon I was thrilled. This is such a great handy thing to use for lotion. My husband hates me asking him to lotion my back, so this is great, and washable which I love. I also use an oil for sore back muscles sometimes and I can use this to apply it myself. Great item.
1- great smell<br />2- excellent cleaner, even stubborn mascara without irritation<br />3- reduces pore size<br />4- makes your moisturizer work better<br />5- makes your make-up glide on<br /><br />Purchase it!
I got this for my daughter, who has really frizzy/wavy hair. She's tried several brands of flat irons, including the expensive ones. She says she really loves this one, and it's her favorite. She says it straightens her hair considerably faster than the others, and stays straighter longer. If you could see her hair, you'd know this is no small feat. I highly recommend it.
Mine came yesterday and it is perfect!  I was looking for a lighted magnifying mirror that would wall mount and I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for it.  This was under $60 and it is all I could ask for.  I bought the chrome.  It really does the job.  Thanks for providing such a superior product at such a great price!
This is a worthy product from a notable seller.  The customer service is superb, shipping is quick, and the minoxidil solution has offered personal results that I haven't seen with 5% solutions.  I've used other 15% solutions, and this is the one I choose by preference.  The Azelaic Acid is a theoretical DHT inhibitor (testosterone conversion to DHT production is the absolute cause of the hair follicle demise....aka hair loss), and combined with the 15% minoxidil mixture, the solution offers the possibility of solid regrowth .  Honestly, I've used this product (in combination with additional regrowth methods) and am receiving results that I have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations (I've used this 15% solution for roughly 5-6 months).  I began thinning in my early 20's and by 25 was shaving my head (which, I didn't mind so much but wasn't completely doing so by preference).  I'm currently 29, and my hair is gaining the density as it once was at 18.  I recommend the product.
i have heard about ENjoy products a few times, and it was recommended by my hairstylist. I still went out on a limb by ordering this pomade, but I LOVE IT!!! I have long straight hair, but after i blowdry/straighten it, it's still a little frizzy and i have flyaways. This pomade helps a ton, you only need about the size of a nickel, and you can use it from root to tip without it looking oily (of course if you use too much, that might not be the case).  Also, is smells SOOOO great! The price is good, i can see it lasting for a long time since a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with the same need as i had.  ;)
I didn't know what the attachments were for so I threw them out.  I turned it on and it blew hot air.  5 stars.
This drier has been working great for me for the last few months and I'm pretty sure I am using it harder than most.  I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.  Only bad thing I have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill, but they don't  seem to be spreading and they haven't given me any trouble.
I originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger. In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.
I bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This dryer is awesome.  It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  My hair feels smoother and healthier after using it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn't like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don't understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls.
This product is of good quality for a very good price. Also  lightweight and not too noisy.
I bought this product almost 3 years ago.  It is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter (or glass).  I recently bought it as a gift for my mom.  She loves it.
Fits the bill perfectly. I sought a small, efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective.  The cord - hanger is a plus, allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way.  I disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting. This dryer is just fine.
I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it. Its out of the way and always neat looking. It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also. Power cord is long enough but not too long. Love it, love it, love it!!
This hair dryer has worked wonders. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results. Leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen. Also, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry hair!
This hairdryer is fantastic. It is powerful, which means it dries fast, lightweight, and includes many different settings. The extra attachments also help for different types of drying. Although other reviews say it is heavy and bulky, the Andis hairdryer is far from it. I would recommend it for anyone.
I was looking for a dryer that was NOT an ion dryer or ceramic, these days that is NOT that easy!!!! I came across this one, had a few good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try....I'm so glad I did! I've had this dryer for a little over 2 years....no problems. I use it every single day with a big diffuser on it. I have naturally curly thin hair and must use a diffuser...this dryer works perfectly for me. At first I didnt think I'd like the smaller size but quickly got over that, now I love it I take it everywhere!  1600 watts is perfect. In fact I love this dryer so much I just bought a second one just in case....!!!! Try it you will not be disappointed!
I bought this for my wife with her long,thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn't powerful enough. I was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so I decided to get her one and she loves it.
I got this for my sister. She absolutely loves it. She does a lot of traveling and is used to a   hairdryer like this.
I bought this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my girlfreind.  She says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned.  I highly recommend.
My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there'd be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I'd wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!
I am very happy with this dryer.  All the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair.  I have a bad right arm and can't use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!
Excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer I have ever used!
I bought this hair dryer because I have the larger version that I use at home and I wanted the same quality for when I travel.  This packs well and I love the retrackable cord.
Did a lot of research on blow dryers and settled on this one based on positive feedback.  Totally worth the money.  Dried my hair and made it a lot straighter than my old dryer and only took half the time!
The Conair 1875 hair dryer is powerful and quiet.  I'm very satified with this purchase.
This is a great hairdryer for the price.  Dries my hair quickly, is lighweight, and easy to use.  I bought two - one for my wife and one for me.  She likes it as much as I do.  Great purchase!
WE USED THIS HAIR DRYER IN A HOTEL ONCE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH WE HAVE ONE IN EVER BATHROOM (7) IN THE HOUSE...  WE LIVE AT THE BEACH SO WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY THEY USE THE HAIR DRYERS AND THEY LOVE THEM..  TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM SO MUCH THEY BOUGHT ONE FOR THEIR HOUSES.......  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THE HAIR DRYER WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT, THE LIGHT WON'T LAST LONG, JUST BUY THIS ONE IT'S THE BEST........
Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!
I have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years. This one is, by far, the best I have used. It is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. I recommend it highly.
I've had mine for a year and a half, it still works great. Turned out to be a great purchase.<br />3/17/2013 It's been over 3 years and it still works like new.
After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  Love this for organization, and it works very well.
This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service.  The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.
Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord.
I bought this for my daughter and am very pleased with my purchase. It is an amazing hair dryer that literally makes your hair softer.I would recommend this to anyone.
I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school. she loves anything that is pink and has the Breast Cancer logo. She said this is the best dryer she has ever had,dries her hair in half the time. She said she loves it,and that it is a great dryer.
Couldn't be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast & on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I'm sure they would function well if you need them. Can't say enough about the color lol!
This is very good. I like it. I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style. awesome!
Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.
my wife and I have used this product for at least 10 years every day and it finally wore out so I had to buy a new one.
I have very long, thick blonde hair. Usually I don't have the patience to blow-dry my hair. I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry. I used this Andis product at a hotel I stayed in in NYC and loved it! It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.<br />I have already recommended it to all of my girlfriends!
Used it for about a year now, have had no problems! It was easy to install and works great! Keeps counter clear and is ready to use.
I love this hair dryer!  On vacation I used my sisters & was so impressed that once I got home, I went online & ordered it.  This hair dryer is the best I've ever bought, and I've had plenty over the years.  Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high. This one is very quiet, almost whooshing it dry.  Also, my hair is smoother than it's ever been after being dried. Could it really be the fact it is tourmaline or ceramic?? No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn't want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  Price was very competitive.
I have two teenage girl's and we have really put this blow dryer through the test. It works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz. Would highly recommend!
Normally it takes me 1/2 hour to dry my long hair, but now only 15 minuites with this FHI 2000 hair dryer. Also, my hair is silky to the touch afterward.  The weigh of this dryer I feel a little bit heavy at first, but it's solid.  I bought this dryer in pink color before, and this black one is for my sister as X'mas gift.  I hope she will like it as much as I do.  Great service from Amazon.  Fast delivery-about a week.  Nice packaging-no damage at all.  Thank you!
I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I've been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn't always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it's a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it's a heck of a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it's still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!
This was definitely worth the purchase! It dries faster than normal hair dryers. Best of all, I have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since I started using it!
I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use. This hair dryer is even better than my old one! It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one. I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.
I replaced a Conair 1600 which was used daily for several years and finally died. I bought this based on the numerous good Amazon reviews and because some have said that the 1850 watt dryers might not work outside the U.S.  Delivery was swift. The dryer feels substantial and well built. It dries more quickly than the old Conair without hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket. As was mentioned before, this will dry anything short of a wookie very quickly. Highly recommended.  10/19/10: Just received a second Andis 33805 ordered 6 days ago as backup in the event this model 33805 is discontinued. The original has performed flawlessly and continues to feel well built.
I also first tried this product while on vacation.  This little hair dryer is compact, light, and powerful.  The best part, however, is the service I got from this vendor!  My order was filled right away, I got it within days, and the price was the best I found by far.  Thanks, Jen!    Anita  Stratford, CT
This is the second unit I've puchased like this, was very pleased with the first one. Very handy, no worries about plugging it in since it's hard wired to begin with. The first unit is about five yrs old now with perfect performance...    Tops St. Louis
This is an excellent blow dryer! I read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn't work right out of the box. Same thing happened to me, except that I realized that if you press the red RESET button on the plug, it works just fine. My hair dries faster, without over-drying. Great price, too!
The dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop.
I bought this for my wife just before a trip to Greece.  It worked flawlessly both here and there.  She combined it with a universal plug system from AAA and found no flaws on either in the US or in Europe.
My first expensive hair dryer. It really does dry faster, leaves my hair in better shape, and is amazingly quiet.
The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  My hair gets dryer much quicker.  A very good product and can't beat the price.  I was searching this product and this price was the cheapest.
I was give my first Jerson First Class hair dryer over 10 years ago.  As soon as I realized it didn't have much life left, I purchased another.  This one is working just as well and perhaps it will also last 10 years.  As long as the company makes this model, that is the only brand I will ever buy.
This is my second 209R.  When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.    This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.    Very highly recommended.
good product, very easy to install. Don't use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product.
I tried this hair dryer at a hotel and loved the fact that it was lightweight yet powerful.  I have problems with my arms and this allowed me to dry my hair without the added weight of those other hair dryers.  I loved it so much, I bought 2!
The dryer was exactly as advertised and I am extremely satisfied with the hair dryer  It was shipped without delay.
I have thick hair and it dries it in a fraction of the time of other dryers.  Heavy but doesn't bother me esp. since I don't have to hold it as long as others.
I love this dryer! It is fast and relatively quiet. I have had great hair days ever since I bought this. Since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so, I am buying a couple extras as backup. I think this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned.
WOW! I searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one. It was the best decision. I am a professional so I have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more! It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair! With no frizz! I love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat!
This dryer works as well as everyone said it does. [...]. Definately a difference in the speed of drying your hair and how it looks afterwards. It is quiet and also a bit heavier to hold than other dryers I have used. The price I paid getting it on Amazon was at least $30 cheaper than what I saw it selling for in the stores. It is worth it...you won't be disappointed.
I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!
I love the blowdryer, the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture, it was a shade of a greenish gold color. other than that it's great.
this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  the three heat settings are amazing too :)  and i can't even say how much i love the retractable cord feature... no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  great product.
Just prefect for hair drying. Dry me hair within 10 sec, and my wife's in 2 mins.<br />Hair feel even softer after.
Can't believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  This is my 2nd T3 dryer.  This one is so much lighter.  Love it..
I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.<br /><br />First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to grab and dry is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.<br /><br />I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don't even notice it!<br /><br />If you're looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!
I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home.  The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.
This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it's soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!
great product
The day I started using this hairdryer, I got compliments on how good my hair looked - no joke!  People asked me if I'd gotten a haircut and I had to tell them no, just a new hairdryer.  It's a powerful machine for how small and compact it is.  It folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag, suitcase or small bathroom drawer.  The cord doesn't retract, which is good in my opinion - my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer, but I've been using for about 2 months now with no problems.  Highly recommend it for the price, value and functionality!
After years of buying those low cost hairdryers that I knew were not helping my thick curly already dry hair, like another reviewer I started researching for the best one I could find and I knew it would be expensive.  Well, this one is absolutely worth every penny.  My hairstylist was using this dryer and it took 1/2 the time to dry my hair.  I love the extra long cord and the various settings.  It was a little heavy at first, compared to my old Vidal Sassoon but I quickly got used to it.  You will not be disappointed.  I'd purchase another one in a heartbeat.
I suppose some people are never satisfied. I read all of the reviews and was amazed at the detail some wrote. For the price and good quality of this hair dryer I continually am amazed at some of the comments. It drys hair better, it doesn't, it's heavy, it's light WTF? The dryer works as well as any my family have had in the last 30 years. It drys hair--That's it. If you want to spend hundreds well, be my guest. As usual, fast delivery, good price and free shipping in certain cases and always a pleasure to shop on Amazon. Buy it--you'll like it! or don't ?? dang!
The hair drier is as it was described, the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier.<br /><br />The United States Parcel Post took 22 days to deliver it.  It would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery.
Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm.
This is one of the best hair dryers I've ever had... I recommend it 100%, and it's worth every penny!!!
Amazingly quick-drying for such a small appliance.  Takes up such little space.  I love, love, love this hair dryer!
I was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the Andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway. great hair dryer would highly recomend this one!!!!!!!!!!!
I have always felt that Conair makes the best dryers.  It is quiet and drys your hair quickly.  Nice black color.  Lightweight.
We used a hairdryer like this in a hotel.  It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  We love it.  It cuts the drying time in half.  It folds for traveling and has a retractable cord.  We love it!
I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  I tried to find locally, but couldn't find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  It is also very attractively styled.  No regrets.
I bought this hair dryer to replace an old Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more 'wind' power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention 'ion'...but on the box it states it is an 'ion' dryer.
I bought 5 of these (with nightlight) to put in each bathroom of my home.  I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction.
Well worth the money.  We always bought inexpensive hair dryers, but now can see the difference a professional model can make.  Would buy again.
I LOVE this blow dryer. Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn't getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed textured hair. It's thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn't soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I'm so glad I did. It's worth every penny in time savings, and I like my hair again, and I actually have a hair style.
Hair dyer works great for it's size. It doesnt over heat like some customers say it does. Works great for condisioning and dying hair. Only drawback I see is it's hard getting everything back into the case
Excellent product, compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight (LED). Nice design , Built in Ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook. Very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation, especially on low speed.
I've ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. I just love this hair dryer! I bought it because I was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter- hair dryer, straightener, curler, husband's shaver charger, etc. So the retractable feature was what drew me to this product. But after using it, I've found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair. It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier. It's also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn't produce the burning smell like older hair driers do. Overall I'd say this is the one product that really impressed me. [...]
This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit. The automatic shutoff feature works great. The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.
This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he's SO jealous!  Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it's not as frizzy either.  GREAT dryer!  OH, and it's SO quiet too, I don't have to worry about waking anyone in the next room when I do my hair.
We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it.
I purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall-mounted unit for our small guest bathroom.  It fits in a tight space quite nicely.  Does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do.  Reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow.  A good purchase at a very reasonable price.  Would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X2UCJO Jerdon First Class Wall Mount Hair Dryer, 1600 watts, 2 Speeds/Heat Settings, White]]
Great service, shipped and arrived on time. Have used the product before and am satisfied with it.
I am very pleased with this product.  I like it even more than the others I have used in many hotels rooms--it's quiet but dries my hair really well. I like the nightlight but I unplug it during the day since it isn't sensitive to light/dark.
fantastic product. I feel like I'm in a hotel when I shower. The price was incredible also.
This little hair dryer is fantastic for the price!  It's speedy and I love the fact it hangs up.  The black is priced much less than the white.  Super Bargain!
This is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon.
Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  I'm a head shaver so I only needed this for my son (occasionally) and for guests.  Works great.
[[ASIN:B0009XH6V4 Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer]]My 10 year old granddaughter never used a hair dryer until she received this one from me as a gift. Now she uses her dryer every night. I wanted her to have a small but powerful dryer, and it is. I will be ordering one for myself today.
The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo is easy to use, moves a lot of air, and packs just as easily as a folding travel hair dryer. It's extremely well constructed and in comparison to my previous folding travel hair dryer, the quality of everything from the breaker plug to switch in the handle, far exceeds my previous unit. Could be used as a everyday hair dryer and takes up very little space.
My favorite blow-dryer! Dries your hair fast (on Turbo setting) with minimal damage.     NOTE: For those with wavy hair, it tended to straighten out my curls a bit, but didn't get rid of frizz so much.
This is the second time I have bought this dryer. My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn't atay hung up anymore. I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years & I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style. Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!
I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer.
I first discovered this little gem of a hairdryer at our condo. while on vacation near Orlando. I was so impressed, I ordered one when I got home and use it as a spare when I go to the gym. There's a lot of power in this little dryer; two speeds - high and low. I prefer high and my hair (which is fairly long and thick) dries very quickly and seems to wave extra nicely with this dryer. I love it!
Thought it was a little heavy when i first used it. I got used to using it and i don't think that now. It's very easy to use. Has 3 different heat settings. Has a low and a high speed. The cord keeper feature is great, saves a lot of space. I'd recommend this hair dryer.
I thought I could never replace my Baby Bliss Professional; however, this product has taken the lead.
HAS EVERITHING I WAS WAITING FOR. IT'S A VALUABLE ITEM. SINCERELY I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT
My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don't need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!
If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it's a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty).
We wanted something that our children could use since we have very limited counter space in the bathroom.  So far, it's been just what we needed.  And, it is much more quiet than hotel wall mounts we have used.
This dryer works great! It provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean
I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  No fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it.  If one leaves the on switch ON and hangs it up, it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again. This is great. on a scale of 1-10 This item scores 11.
This dryer exceeds expectations.  Dries hair fast, is quiet and light weight (big plus) and no frizzies!  In fact, sometimes it makes my hair too silky so I have to use more harsh shampoo or only a teenie weenie bit of conditioner.
I purchased this for my sister, who has long, naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair.  She also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight.  This one fit the bill; she loved it on the first use.  Her hair was smooth & shiny and the dryer works great.  A great value!
Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn't have fingers; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I've used.  It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  The only drawback I can see is it's quite large so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.
It is very handy, does a good job drying my hair. I liked it so well I bought a second one for the other bathroom.
This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I used to swear by the Chi but this one is not even comparable!  Very happy with it!
If you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel....why not have the same at home ! This mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered. It is attractive...works well and out of the way.
Have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase.
fast, lightweight and durable.   This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   Not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy.   I love this hairdryer!
VERY nice dryer. Larger sized travel. Nice power & doesn't frizz my hair like my old dryer did. Happier with a full-sized travel than the compact ones... dries hair faster & without the frizz!
On a recent trip one of our hotels had this dryer in the room and my wife liked it so much I ordered one.  Now it's her favorite.
This hair dryer has a large hood so I can use fat curlers.  It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  It is light weight and very stable when set up. It is a great product for the price.
I mainly purchased this hair dryer to bring some order into our bathroom. A bit more expensive than a standard hair dryer (i.e. just a dryer with a cord), but worth it.  The dryer was easy to mount on the wall.  The cord & dryer now stay out of way, and the night light (sufficient to light that way in the middle of the night) is a nice bonus. Of course, the dryer does a good job as well.  I can recommend this product.  Update: 1 year later, works great.  Bought a 2nd one.
A MUST HAVE FOR FREEZY/CURLY /UNRULY HAIR ,MAKES BLOW DRYING A BREEZE,I PURCHASED ONE ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO...STILL GOING STRONG!I USE IT EVERY DAY,ALSO FOR TOUCH UPS, SO I'VE DECIDED TO GET A NEW ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE(JUST IN CASE SHE DECIDES TO MOVE OUT...:)),FAIRLY LIGHT,RIGHT PRICE,AND COMBINED WITH AMAZON SERVICE AND RELIABILITY.........PRICELESS ,GO FOR IT ,YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.<br />Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.<br />Highly recommend this hair dryer!
We've owned one of these before and loved it.  It hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it's always handy.  When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon. Easiest way to make a wife happy!
I love this blow dryer! The first time I used it I couldn't believe how much volume and thickness I had in my usually limp hair! I rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared. Definitely worth the investment.
This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended!
This dryer is perfect for travel.  It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  It is perfect for me.  I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  Excellent product!
I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.<br /><br />I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It's true that the dryer doesn't seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.
great dryer, works well.  Lots of heat and volume when I need it, nice cooling button.  Dries my hair fast.  Amazon got it to me overnight when mine died, so I only went 1 day with bad hair.  Not bad, because I don't have time to shop at the brick and mortar.
I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I'm done is all I need.  Plus it's lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!
I love this hair dryer.  It is the best one I have ever owned in terms of making my fine hair look amazing.  I recommend this hair dryer to any one and be sure to use the large attachment to it for great results!
I was sick of buying cheaper dryers and having them break after a year, so I decided to spend more on something professional. This hair dryer is quieter than any other I've used and dries my hair in half the time! It is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now 3 and a half years since my initial review and I am still extremely pleased with this hair dryer... It was definitely worth the investment!
This is a great hairdryer. It's light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn't make my hair frizzy.
It's a hairdryer.  It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot.  That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry.  Hardly rocket science.  It does all the above well.<br /><br />The ion function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.<br /><br />The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too.
This is a great blowdryer.  I had one before and this one is a little different, but it works great.  I love it!  Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn't do, which is a great feature for traveling.  High speed - dries hair quickly! Very fast shipper too!  Thanks! Love it!
This is our third Oster Wall Hair Dryer.  We've used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  We don't have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter.  It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.
I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I'll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful.
This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time. It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum). It is a perfect size for any bathroom (we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another). The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang. That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer.

ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED. I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY
Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn't fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!
I am so pleased with this dryer.  Works great and is so handy in my bathroom.  Now I don't have those cords hanging all over and it doesn't take up counter space.  Very handy.
No more mess in the kids bathroom. They love it and so do I. No problem with dryer strength. Lots of hair on both.
I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn't use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.
This dryer is worth the money!  I've been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don't notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!
Purchased for domestic travel. Solid construction, compact, and the high heat speed has a powerful air flow for such a small head size. Drys hair fast. Has low heat speed if you need it. Very satisfied with purchase!
I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had. It is also not overly bulky. I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.
I bought this for my wife when her old one started making a hideous shrieking noise. She is happy with it so far. It doesn't get stupid hot so it doesn't damage her hair. That is important to her. She has never mentioned it feeling heavy so IT'S NOT. Trust me, this 94lb woman asks for help lifting a gallon of milk, so really you should be fine.    I don't know about the ION aspect, I mean it blows hot, dry air. Even the box it came in didn't sound too convinced, using phrases like ions may be emitted, which could possibly make hair shinier. Whatever, it does the job, and doesn't wake the dead.
This dryer gets the job done: just want it dry?  It's fast and powerful and you can easily direct it.  It also comes with two attachments, one for straightening, the other for zeroing down on problem areas.  I love the color too - it's bright and cheery.
I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand...
great dryer,quite, does the job. the best dryer i have ever used. my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.
Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  This one does.  Hair feels amazing and it's incredibly fast.  Can't beat the price either.
I've been using hair dryers since 1975, and this is by far the best I've ever owned. It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago.
I've owned many hairdryers over the years...they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  None has been anything to get excited about.  I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it's not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  It still provides plenty of heat to set the curve, but the air velocity doesn't blow my hair off the brush.  My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  Fantastic!
I love this product.  My hairdresser told me to buy it and I couldn't be happier.
This product drys your hair quickly,therefore causing less damage. It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair.
Let me address the title of the review. From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.
This was an excellent buy and a great product.  I saved around $20.00 as compared to discount stores in my area.  The shipping was supposed to be 5-7 business days and I received it in 2 days!  I am always very satisfied with amazon.com purchases.
This thing has unbelievable bang-for-buck.  It's compact, comfortable, and powerful.  If you need a compact hairdryer buy this one. You won't be dissapointed.
I do my share of traveling with work and personal.  I noticed that I always used the hair dryer that was hanging up in the hotel bathroom.  I rarely used it at home.  I realized the convenience of ready to go made the difference.  No more cords to untangle before plugging in.  I am extremely satisfied with my new Andis 30975.  Plus now there isn't an ion to be found on my head.
It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  Also, it's much quieter than my previous one with all the added power.
Used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much I had to order one for home as soon as I got back!  Doesn't have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  Would definitely recommend.
I love this dryer! I'll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again. This one is quieter and even though it doesn't blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well. My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days. She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it. A great deal too!
I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....with this blow dryer it was cut to 15 minutes!  Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..it's much quiter than the average blow dryer.  I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon. The only draw back is that it's a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....but I figure that's good for my arms!  A great purchase!
This wall mounted hair dryer is so nice... I also have the Sunbeam 1500 but I prefer this one.  It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  It's a great product.
IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS MY CHI DRYER.THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER. IM A HAIRDRESSER AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH WAS INTERSTED IN IT WHEN THEY SAW THE COLOR OF IT.IT REALLY WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.
This is a great dryer. It blows hard which is what I wanted. I have short bleached hair. I don't use the attachments. I haven't noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair. It has a nice long cord which I also like. Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It's louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don't think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I'm happy with it.
LOVED this hair dryer! Didn't even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn't resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn't believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don't need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it's quieter (big plus since my baby's bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)
This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also.
You can't get much for $20 these days.  However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn't be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  =o)
This has cut down on my drying time and is very gentle to my hair.  While it is expensive, it is well worth it.
Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here's the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their authorized vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared...
With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I'm in love. It doesn't take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I've owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don't accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.
This is the best standard blow dryer on the market.Plenty of power and heat.Nothing else compares.This will keep that 80's hair blown back for shure.This was made for Bon Jovi & Rod Stewart types.
only problem (?) is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil, but that is about it. i like it and it works great!
Lightweight and super fast. With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time. I can't remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry. Not anymore! I also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model. Worth every penny.
Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure.
Pros:  - Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    Cons:  - Power cord length is not adjustable  - Included mounting screws/anchors are flimsy    I bought this Andis dryer to replace a similar type Conair unit that died after about a year's use.  My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.
Abolutely love this! It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!
The best, hands down! My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight! I use this in conjuction with the revo styler, resolve or lavei shampoo. I also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner. Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    Even other Andis blow dryers can't touch the performance of this one. Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers.
I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I'm buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents.
I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I've used in the past.  The telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category.
I bought this wall-mounted dryer to free-up some space in the kids bathroom, and it works great. The nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn't too loud. The bracket mounted easily once I pounded the raised Ground screw terminal flat. The bracket won't lay flat against the wall with the raised Ground screw terminal on the bracket. The cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but everyone in the family really likes it.
I have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home, and it is.  No more messes on the counter or sink, and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in...
We were traveling and in one hotel my husband commented this wall mount hair dryer is great!  Next morning I ordered one from Amazon.  It arrived 3 days later and he is a happy man!
I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don't need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.<br /><br />I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.<br /><br />You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients.
I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand. Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.
I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  I feel it was worth the splurge, although I'm glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.
Small and powerful.  It dries my hair as fast as my full-sized dryer and doesn't take up nearly as much space.  Also, my hair (which is prone to fuzziness when blown dry) doesn't come out fuzzy.
Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  I used the tape and haven't had any problems in over month.    I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  Now I don't have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning.  It's right there hanging next to the mirror.    I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  The lower setting is good if you don't want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  The high setting is powerful and loud.
A bit old fashioned, but I've had one around for years!  They work for me!
I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!
Having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues, this is the perfect dryer for me. I also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years. So what else could you want? I have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers. This fits my needs perfectly. Love it!
The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance.  It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.  This is the BEST of the lot.  I actually gambled and bought two at once because compact dryers are getting hard to find now, and my confidence has been rewarded.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick solution to get going in the morning after your shower, look no further.  This one's a winner!
I have a very old Conair Prostyle 1600 - my favorite hand held dryer, and after over 10 years, it's been on its way out.  I've tryed various dryers, but none of them have the great feel of my old Conair.  I just recently ordered the Conair Yellowbird 1875...thought it would be great - looked just like my old one, only yellow.  I tried it once and sent it back.  It was too heavy..unlike the Conair 1600, which was oh so light...and surprisingly didn't have the blow power I expected.  So I read one review on the Andis Pro Style 1600 and it sounded good.  I tried it this morning and it's perfect - very light...and so small, I couldn't believe it.  I travel on business and have not found a travel dryer I'm happy with, so I'm going to order another of these for a travel dryer.
It works. The cord feature is great. The price is right. What else is there to say.
This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com
This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn't straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I'd been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don't have a warranty with it, but I'm very happy with this appliance.
With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use. <br /> <br />The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9) aren't long enough to make its use practicable. <br /> <br />Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer.
This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.<br /><br />The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.<br /><br />In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.<br /><br />Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.
None available.
Definitely worth the money. I have been using this for a couple of months and have had no problems with. Was nervous the first time I washed it in the washing machine, but it came out like new.
Not pure lavender oil but it works well.  It is not too greasy and it is very flexible in the way it can be used.  You can use it in baths, after shower/bath or in massages.  Better than advertised.
Not much can be said about a product that is pretty perfect in every respect. I have been using this toothbrush for almost two years now and cannot imagine ever going back to hand brushing. There is such a marked difference between this and hand-brushing that you can literally feel. My teeth have never felt cleaner and my gums have never been healthier. While I used to have pretty bad dental hygiene habits (I used to brush only about two times a day) this toothbrush has helped me improve me regimen tremendously. The results have been nothing short of miraculous. <br /> <br />I take this toothbrush everywhere I can and the charge tends to last several days before recharging is needed. At any rate, I suppose the only shortcoming of this toothbrush lies in the problems encountered when traveling a lot: The base station is simply too bulky to conveniently pack away and take with you. While this is not an issue on shorter trips, travelling in excess of a week will make you scramble for an alternative travel toothbrush. If this toothbrush came with a smaller travel charger, it would indeed be absolutely perfect.
Dryer is very quiet and powerful. Easy to install. Night Light has a nice green glow. Highly recommend this product.
After having read the majority of the reviews here, I'm happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!
I have purchased four Jerdon wall mount hair dryers - one for my home and three for our lake house. They are dependable and affordably priced.
My wife loves the hair dryer (and she is fussy about such appliances) and my little two year old loves the retracting cord!  Good dryer at a good price.
I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom. The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation. Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!
I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!<br />FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own. Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn't look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom! ~ Mrs. B.
This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it. It fits perfectly in a small space, and it is as inconspicuous as a wall-mounted dryer could be. It works very well, too --it is quite powerful for such a petite dryer. I really love it!
The initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died. My decision was based on price and product name and couldn't give a hoot about the ION feature. After a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different. Good to know that it wasn't my imagination. Also, I found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old Conair dryer. It's so cool in fact that I don't hesitate putting it away immediately after use.
My wife just loves this hair dryer - so convenient - no more hauling the old one out from under the sink, unplugging the nite-lite, etc.  And the nite-lite is great!  Those mid-night visits are safe and lighted - no fumbling around with those other 'soft-lights'.
We have found the Andis to be comperable to the dryers found in the more upscale hotels. The hang up cord is a great feature that helps keep cords organized. The night light gives plenty of light for finding your way around the bathroom at night. Two speeds supply plenty of drying power. Nice design, easy to mount.
This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift.  It dries your hair fast.  Saves a lot of time.  Well worth the price
This hair dryer has a lot of power.  The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working.
I have nothing but good review of this product. <br />Great product at a great price.
For me, this dryer has been fantastic! I have had it for 3 months and use it 3 or 4 times a week; and, I have no problems with it at all. It is compact, which means it takes up very little space. I would recommend it, based on my experience.
I bought this hair dryer for a rental condo in a chic downtown community and it fits RIGHT in !
An excellent product. It is very efficient, and, packable! Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set. Highly recommended.
I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised. At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place. Almost 10 years, not bad at all!
Plenty of power. Plenty of heat. Like the night light, but would like to be able to switch it off if I wanted ... but can't do that. If I kept this near my ears for a long time, the noise would be an issue, but since I don't, it isn't. Just a nice little device.
I looked at local retail stores and couldn't find wall mount units.  Don't know why anyone would want one just lying on the counter.  I was skeptical of the Ionic feature, but I believe my hair feels softer and less straw-like after using this dryer.  Feels well made and should last.  At first I thought the high speed wasn't powerful enough, but I think the quietness of this unit is deceptive.  It's really blowing as much air as my old dryer, which was good, but it's so much quieter that you think it's not as powerful.  The night light is quite bright and is a pleasing green, but I wish I could turn it off during the daytime.
This hair dryer really dose make your hair softer, I have had it a month now and I use it only if I have wet hair before bed or going out and it only takes about 5 min to dry my hair (my older one took 30) I highly recimend it.
I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!
I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)
I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer.
I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!
I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it's worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it's improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas.
LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target.
I love this dryer not only is it QUIET, it really does make my hair shiny and silky.  I bought this because I simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus.   I have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered, I liked how my hair felt-particularly here where it can be extremely humid. I was pleasantly surprised.  Although another reviewer found the weight a problem, it was no heavier than my old dryer. I love it!!!!
